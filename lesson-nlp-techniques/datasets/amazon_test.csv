I was looking for something similar, as I've found that fruit flavored teas are my favorite, although Earl Grey is among the few I've tried and enjoyed. I meant to get the Douwe Egberts Pickwick Tea Compiback Fruits, as it includes 6 different flavors.<br /><br />I'm not disappointed in my purchase. Black tea is the only tea I've enjoyed, and the Forest Fruit tea has a wonderful smell. Raspberry and strawberry are the most evident, to me. The ingredients list blackberry and blueberry, as well.

557608,"M.D. Edwards ""Avid Aesthete""",4,1302998400,"An adult, Foodie-worthy step up from the tuna lunch kits out there!","I'm a regular consumer of Starkist's Chunk Light Tuna Lunch Kits. There's always at least one to three of them sitting in my desk drawer at work. I love the crackers that are packaged with those kits, as well as the individual pouches of condiments that can either be added or omitted from your chosen mixture. But those kits, while about half of the price of these, pale in comparison to this kit, if you're looking for something more adult, more elegant, and more Foodie-friendly.<br /><br />GoPicnic's Salmon + Crackers ready to eat meal comes very smartly packaged, with a small, eco-friendly cardboard box that can be closed securely, with a tab that actually, really stays in place and keeps it closed. The box is rife with information and entertainment, from food product blurbs to fun games meant for adults, as opposed to kids.<br /><br />Also highly adult-friendly are the extra little snacks and treats enclosed with the main dish of salmon ""salad"" and Ritz-type crackers. The snack mix containing the ginger-glazed peanuts, dried cranberries, and banana chips is sweet, crunchy, and chewy all at once. It's a small pouch of snack mix, and the peanuts ARE rather sweet, but being a BIG fan of ginger, I loved the spicy bite of ginger, and how well they paired with the banana chips and dried cranberries. Definitely a step up from other trail mixes, and delicious. The dry-roasted Edamame are DEFINITELY dry (be sure to keep some sort of drink on hand if you plan to eat these in one sitting - you'll NEED some liquid to choke these all down!), but very tasty, and pretty filling. They hit the spot if you're craving a lightly salted, crunchy, nutty treat, but just remember that they ARE dry!<br /><br />As for the salmon spread itself, don't expect yours to look like what's pictured on the box. At least, mine didn't. It was more of a salmon salad puree' with a few cursory chunks of salmon thrown in to remind you that it really did come from an actual fish. Taste-wise, it was very tasty to me, but DID need the crackers to cut the strong flavor. Salmon DOES have a stronger flavor than tuna salad, which I was aware of already, but I enjoy canned and fresh salmon both, so it wasn't terribly off-putting to me. There was a subtle hint of lime, and the spice of the chili perked it up just enough for me, so overall, the flavors combined well, but I felt compelled to eat the salmon mixture on the Ritz-type crackers, whose buttery, flaky taste were a perfect complement. As for the crackers themselves, they were as good as I'd hoped they'd be, and even better than the ones I've come to enjoy so much from the Starkist tuna lunch kits (an unrelated product, but similar). There were enough of them to get me through the small tray of salmon salad from start to finish, and they smoothed out the more distinctive taste of the salmon salad. For me, it really didn't matter whether they were organic or not, but it's a thoughtful consideration for GoPicnic to have made for their potential customers that WOULD have taken issue with it. The one thing that I think GoPicnic SHOULD swap out here, though, is the plastic fork that came enclosed in my kit - a plastic knife would've been much more helpful, but its omission wasn't a deal-breaker for me.<br /><br />Not being a huge chocolate fan on average, and one who avoids dark chocolate in general, I was very pleasantly surprised by the smooth taste of the dark chocolate square included in this kit. I've grown to expect dark chocolate to be bitter, and this square was not. It had a great snap and crunchy bite, was just sweet enough, and was deliciously smooth and creamy, so I was very, very pleased with it. I can see why the chocolate square enclosed in this kit got rated as the best-tasting organic dark chocolate out there. It was really very, very good.<br /><br />Overall, I found this lunch kit to be more than adequate for me as a lunch option, as opposed to simply a snack. With all of the different components in it, all of the small- to medium-sized portions of items added up to, for me, a very filling lunch. The price is a little higher than I'm used to for my fish salad lunch kits, but the product that you get is definitely worth it. It's a step up all around from what I'd grown accustomed to, and had everything in that small box that I believe most people would want.<br /><br />A delicious product for a good price. High quality ingredients, and plenty of sweet and salty treats to satisfy all around! Good stuff!",0

I was sad about that.<br /><br />I was actually really hoping for something limey! And Spicy! But don't expect that here.  I've almost gone through a whole bag, and maybe 1% of the bites have a hint of lime?  Zero bites have had a hint of chili.  99% taste like regular unflavored tortilla chips.  Well...a suuupppper small hint of flavor.  I'm almost wishing I had bought the pico de gallo instead.<br /><br />Basically, if you've been eating any chili-lemon flavored cheetos, completely wipe your memory and expectations- nothing that bold and tangy here.  (Which can be good and bad, my hubby hated the cheetos chili-lemon unspicy flavor and was worried we'd get that here, so he's happy we didn't.  I was looking forward to getting that popping taste, and am sad that wasn't there.)<br /><br />** WARNING: If you've never ordered full size bag of chips from amazon, be warned, 12 bags is A LOT!!!

487149,Julie,3,1342915200,"Captures that movie theater taste, but far from perfect","I purchased this product for use with my new Maxi-Matic popcorn machine, with the goal of producing that movie-theater taste that none of my previous popping efforts had replicated. These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot-on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another brand's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.<br /><br />Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn.",0

343256,"Michelle Johnson ""Myche""",5,1282953600,"cats love it, and it's good for them.","Our little monster, Gary, had problems when he was a kitten. When we rescued him he had flea anemia so bad that he had to have a blood transfusion. His intestines never fully developed and he alternated diarrhea and severe constipation his entire life. We were giving him laxatone and lactulose 2x a day. When he recently had a severe bout of diarrhea and a possible UTI, the vet prescribed Hills Science diet c/d. What a crock that stuff is! I did my own research (and I encourage you to do the same) and found that cats should get their water from their food. The Wellness canned food I feed my cats now has 78% water. After feeding them Wellness for three weeks, little Gary is off the meds he's been taking for three years, and our other cat Sugar has lost weight and is much more active. Neither of them drink hardly any water from their bowls anymore, which scared me a little at first, but is apparently normal and good. Gary has only had a few problems since the switch. Yes, the food is expensive, but we're saving money on vet bills and not having to buy prescriptions anymore. I am more than thrilled with the Wellness canned chicken cat food!",1

This sauce is perfect in taste, when prepared right. I've been making my Alfredo with this Four Cheese Knorr Sauce for about 5 yrs now. And my family and I absolutely love it.

Yes. I'd even say as a mixer, it'd be fine. There is a heavy aftertaste of carmelized sugar, and that does impact the taste of the cola itself but it is drinkable even if the folks used to Atlanta's finest despise it. Muddy it up with something like flavored syrup (cherry, vanilla, etc) or Rum and it isn't as noticeable.<br /><br />Also remember that with cola and other ""dark"" syrups, you have to increase the level of carbonation.

Tearing the top off at the ""tear here"" line always leaves part of the top intact, making getting the coffee out a chore, and trying to tear off the rest of the sticky top is not worth the effort.  Next, the flavor.  I know Italian is supposed to be bold and bitter, but this stuff takes bitter to a whole new level.  Not good.  Then there's the expiration.  I didn't plan to use this very often, but I'd better, because it expires in less than a month.  What?  Finally, the cost.

It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br /><br />Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.

145032,E. Swope,5,1324425600,Best bread I have made yet!,"I am really REALLY happy with this flour!  i started baking routinely (again) a few years ago when Amazon offered an exceptional deal on a bread machine (something I thought I'd never buy); but it did make it easier to bake while working....(adding one more thing to an already crowded week).  After seeing the nearly ubiquitous ""no-knead"" recipe I went back to doing it by hand.  However, while that looked like ""artisan bread,"" it was basically commercial white but in a different shape: garbage in- garbage out as they say in tech circles.  If you are using bleached white flour and commercial yeast, what you get is commercial white bread (albeit without the preservatives and other junk mass manufacturers add).  I'll note, for those of you who have stumbled on that recipe, it is a 200 year old recipe;, essentially sourdough, but made without either the wild yeast or fermentation (which gives sourdough its flavor).  All that said, having discovered that I began my own (wild yeast sourdough) cultures and now have half a dozen around my kitchen (which is starting to look like a lab.  In the past year I have made something on the order of 100 loaves of bread, and despite many tweaks, it was never quite there (not as good as I had hoped).  This flour made the difference~  For the first time I turned out a loaf of bread as good as any I have had~  You may not notice as much of a difference if you are using commercial yeast (though I expect there will still be some), however.... it made a HUGE difference with my sourdough cultures.  The bleaching and processing in most flour knocks out the natural yeasts.  This flour really took off~ My loaves were roughly 1/3 larger than any I had made before as the yeasts were more active and the rise better.  I hope Amazon keeps carrying this as it made a bigger difference than any other thing I have done.  (I would, however, recommend the addition of an oven stone <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000E1FDA"">Old Stone Oven 4467 14-Inch by 16-Inch Baking Stone</a> (for example) if you do not already have one,which added more to the quality, as kitchen gear goes, than anything else.  However, nothing matters more than what you put in it.  This flour is visibly different; a different color (unbleached, looks almost like graham flour) and texture (stone ground flour leaves more of the germ intact).<br /><br />I came to Amazon looking for this after reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0688092616"">Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands</a> widely hailed as the bible of artisan bread.  She recommended stone ground flour (in fact, it was specified in all of the recipes).  Before I tried this, I would not have believed what a difference it would make!  I am sure there are other good stone ground flours out there, but... I am very happy with this and will absolutely stick with it as long as Amazon carries it!<br />Beyond the quality, I like that there 9s variety. (I usually buy 20-50 lb. bags of bread flour).  It is nice to have variety.  Although it has been mentioned before, the variety I received included unbleached bread flour, whole wheat bread flour, pastry flour and corn meal.  I have only used the 2 bread flours so far, nut am happy enough with them that I am going to up my subscription (and stop buying those large sacks of white flour).  Even though I mixed them (adding whole grains...this is very much better, so much so that my 14 year old broke into the second loaf while I was out of the house.

Unlike most teas, you use coffee preparation techniques to make Redespresso.<br /><br />Per the directions, I did prepare the tea in a french press.

The only thing they don't tell you is that the boost is so great that you'll want them all the time and they aren't cheap.<br /><br />Granted, I don't take these during the day at work - I'm a tea drinker and that keeps me going. When I head to go play basketball after work (3-4 times a week) I take one 15 minutes before I play. There is a noticeable difference in my energy levels out there when I have one, and when I do not. After a week of trying them out I was hooked. I'm an Ironman triathlete and consider myself to be in great cardio shape - knowing the performance edge that I seem to get from these, I would definitely use them on race day and again, can't say enough about the energy boost that accompanies these things.<br /><br />Anyway, you may not see a huge difference if you're sitting at your desk and take one - Honestly, I have no idea, I've just never used them that way. But...if you're going to work out, going on a run, going to play basketball or something to that effect, take one...and I think you'll be sold.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you'll need to sell your liver on eBay to sustain your habit...they are not cheap.",1

84756,Gluten-Free Foodie,2,1266451200,Meh.,"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.

It may be that I am reacting to the omnipresence of that bitter, over-roasted stuff Starbucks pours. Well, this Marley blend is bitter as well, but intrinsically so, with a tongue-slapping sting. I don't feel that it is a product of over-roasting, but rather, the nature of the bean. I like it. It makes me want to sip it while alternating chocolate mousse and cabernet. Seriously. Try that combination for dessert sometime. It is the great triumvirate.<br /><br /> I am particular about my coffee and yet compromise my taste by going the K-cup route. doing the 200 degree water drip through the unbleached paper with freshly ground beans thing is not for me on an very early weekday morning. I can barely put my pants on, let alone manipulate a container full of near-boiling water. That level of love is left for the weekend, when I have the time to take the time to linger lovingly over proper preparation as if it were the Tea Ceremony.<br /><br />That being said, there is no need to compound the sin of employing a pod or K-cup while using that stuff that sits on the grocer's shelf for months.

(By the way, I actually saw Bob Marley walking by himself on West 57th Street in the late seventies).  Anyway, this coffee is meant for Pod coffee makers - did not realize this when I requested the coffee.  I do not own a pod coffeemaker.  You get 15 individual pod packets.  Each pod holds a single serving/cup of coffee.  To enable brewing in my coffee maker, I just cut the pods open and dumped into a coffee filter, and voila!  Coffee has nice rich aroma, and it has a full flavor.  It's definitely a better coffee than I had been drinking, which was your basic old school supermarket stuff.  For reference, I am not someone who tolerates strong coffee well.  Starbucks can give me a panic attack!

None of the PB's had much flavor, kinda bland. I noticed it was very runny - so we stirred em up a bit and put them in the fridge to stiffen up. A day or so later, we tried them again - even more bland from the fridge. Maybe I didn't stir em up enough? I don't know - but now they're too hard to stir at all, so we'll see if we have the will to finish a jar or two if they get any more flavorful? Overall, we think it's way overpriced for the taste. We won't be buying any more jars, which is a shame cause I did want to support the fledgling company. I do wish them the best of luck though. To be fair we ONLY tried the 3 PB flavors. Nothing else..

Even after it arrived, I didn't dive right into it. After a couple days I decided to make some and see what all the hype was about. One taste and I am hooked. The flavor is amazing! I had it hot and then I made some cold. They were both awesome! I mixed up a tumbler full for my daughter for her morning tea at work and she absolutely loved it. She said she thought it would also taste great in cupcakes and I agree! Now my wheels are turning about all the awesome ways I can incorporate this flavorful Matcha into recipes. On Red Leaf Tea's website they have some delicious recipes for smoothies, frappes etc that I can not wait to try. I love that there are so many possibilities of ways to use this tea besides drinking it (which is awesome in itself!).<br />I have been trying to diet but have a bit of a sweet tooth. Drinking this Caramel & Madagascar Vanilla was like having a dessert. I was totally satisfied. With a bit of sweetener added to these already uniquely superb flavors, this was like drinking a high calorie fattening dessert but was actually guilt free and healthy.<br />Finally, I definitely need to comment on the amount of energy I feel after drinking this tea. It is a really good energy not like a coffee or sugar rush. My whole transition from coffee and soft drinks to tea was to reap the vast health benefits associated with tea. I was pleasantly surprised when I read the various and significant health benefits of Matcha tea.

If you like hearty, pumpkin, fall spice type of foods this is definitely for you. I would note however, the extreme crunchiness of these bars may not be conducive to someone who has a hard time chewing, and/or beware, as the grains/seeds have a tendency (not unlike popcorn hulls) to stick in teeth, maybe not great for anyone with dentures/braces.

539371,Chambolle,3,1240617600,Cats love it -- but I am concerned,"This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.",0

I have used my own home-made black salve which was created from the bloodroot in several trial variations for a lot of times on the wort, but to no avail. The wort is still there. Nevertheless, I figured since I paid $40 for the lb, there must be something that I can use this herb for, so I did some google searches and found that it is simply a red version of tumeric, which is good for cooking, among other uses. The bloodroot is much more potent than its relative, yellow tumeric, so it takes much less of the red one for seasoning soups. I am still glad to have the powder, because of its reputation of curing and/or preventing tumerous cancers, among other things.

It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product.

It has satisfied my desire for peanut butter more than I expected and I can even feed regular peanut butter to my dogs or husband without cheating!  An earlier review mentioned that 2 Tb weighed more than it stated on the label; I only found this to be true if I pack down the powder tightly, so I don't.  2 Tb seems an adequate amount for a sandwich or a snack.

73736,a consumer,5,1338508800,Xylitol junkie loves this gum :-),"Before I developed gum diease, I was not a big chewing gum fan.  Now I use a lot of xylitol products, because the bacteria in your mouth will ""eat"" xylitol, but cannot digest it.  If you use xylitol products regularly and often, you basically starve the bacteria in your mouth so there is less of it, and you are thus less likely to develop cavities and gum issues.<br /><br />So... I'm chewing this for the xylitol, not for pleasure or entertainment. The flavor of most xylitol chewing gums does not last long, and I'm ok with that because I'm looking just to dose my mouth with xylitol every few hours.<br /><br />That said, this is really tasty gum.  It is unlike any other chewing gum flavor out there.  It satisfies my desire for something sweet better than the usual spearmint, fruit or cinnamon.  Texture-wise, it doesn't break down into bits or become stiff and rubbery, so your jaws don't ache after a while.<br /><br />If you're a xylitol fan and looking for a fresh flavor, and if you like your gum sweet sometimes, definitely give this a try.",1

I've sampled Irish teas in Ireland, the best British teas in England, not to mention great American brands like Stash.  But the brand I've been buying and using regularly is Zhena's Gypsy Teas.  Earl Grey is my favorite tea generally, and the raspberry shes adds to the Earl Grey is a distinctive and pleasant addition. The coconut chai is great on a cold morning-- brew it in your cup filled only half-way with water; then add warm milk to fill the cup (I add two teaspoons of raw sugar, but use your own preferred sweetener)-- it will sooth your soul and make any task at work manageable.  It is a moment of zen in a teacup.<br /><br />At first, I found the flavor of the rose tea a little odd, but I've grown to like it and now it's one of my favorites.  I also like her raspberry earl grey; in fact this morning, I ran out of her earl grey and used another brand marketed by a famous chef- it doesn't compare.<br /><br />If you're concerned about the waste of the attractive metal cans, instructions are on the container for purchasing the tea in bulk and reusing the containers.

The product description says that there are two servings per 1.7 oz bar. Now, 1.7 oz = 3 bites. Which means that a serving size is 1 1/2 bites. Just who is it who makes up these standards anyway? This is ludicrous if you ask me. The cost/benefit ratio here is so low as to be ridiculous.<br /><br />So, if price point is not an issue with you, then this would be a fair product.

This helped cut down on the sweetness of the cookie (as I feel most mixes are too sweet). Adding these ingredients produced a soft, chewy, somewhat cake like cookie.<br /><br />These cookies were not quite up to the same standard as some of the wonderful bakeries in NY, but definitely good enough for gift giving or a household gathering (far better than some of the mixes that cove in a pouch with a red spoon logo).",0

When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!",1

I called Kellogg about a month ago to ask if they are using genetically engineered ingredients and they said they do use them because the FDA says they are safe and Kellogg's complies with the FDA regulations. I called Kellogg's again yesterday (twice) and this time they told me that they don't know if their products contain GMOs because they don't test for them. Kellogg has pumped $632,500 into the propaganda campaign in California that is fighting to trick people not to vote for Prop. 37, for the labeling of genetically engineered foods.

We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them.

I have tried many versions, and while one would think that water is water, they really do taste differently.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought this water tasted good.  I chose to chill mine before drinking it, and found it to be very refreshing, without any chemical or metallic taste that I was able to detect.  It tasted, in short, like water.  I did not think the change in pH made it taste any differently, so that is a real positive for me.<br /><br />While I cannot speak to the accuracy of the claims of the benefits to this particular formula of water, I can say that if the water does indeed contain the additional electrolytes, this provides a good alternative to sugary high calorie sports drinks.<br /><br />Many reviewer commented that this is merely treated water from municipalities, as opposed to spring water, and therefore not worth the cost.  If this were the sole source of my water intake, I would agree.  I would not purchase this for the whole of my drinking and cooking water.

I'm wondering if it's because Amazon's stock is old;  more oxidation might make this more bitter than it should be.<br /><br />Kudos to Bigelow for even trying to bring cheap Oolong to the masses--but if you really want to know what oolong is supposed to taste like, look elsewhere.",0

My Dr. told me to stop drinking the soda stream diet cola (I believe all the flavors have sulfites, but I could be wrong) for several weeks.  I complied and stuck with good old Diet Coke.  My face cleared up within a few days and was cyst free.  Them my Dr. instructed me to make a batch of the diet cola in the 1 liter bottle and drink it throughout 1 day.  The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.

505095,"Patricia ""A Reader""",4,1267747200,N O T......B A D...............B U T........,"It is delightfully convenient to buy bread on Amazon.com!  It is also very nice to be able to buy EUROPEAN bread.  I don't remember what health-food book I read this in, but, in passing, this book mentioned that Americans, (especially American children), who visit Europe are often heard to joyfully be saying: ""Have you tasted the BREAD?!!!!!""<br /><br />MESTERNACHER THREE-GRAIN BREAD is my first European bread.  It is tasty, (I was afraid I wouldn't like the taste) -- yet, my American taste still would like a sweeter bread.  Still, not bad tasting at all.  The truly wonderful thing about this bread, however, is that IT CONTAINS NO WHEAT!  Wheat has its place in the diet, I suppose...but limiting it is important, because, amongst other things, wheat is said to be bad for people with arthritis of ANY kind, and wheat is also said to be bad for ANYONE'S eyes.  I'm not too knowedgeable about wheat's good and bad qualties -- but I do know the above two facts.  I also have heard bad things about wheat GLUTEN.  Presumably, wheat products without the gluten are better than those with gluten. Mestermacher Three-Grain Bread, however, has NO WHEAT AT ALL.  So, one does not have to worry about any bad effects of wheat, at all!<br /><br />What does this bread have in it, if it doesn't have wheat?  The ingredient list is:<br /><br />Whole Kernel Rye<br />Water<br />Wholemeal Rye Flour<br />Oat Kernels<br />Barley Kernels<br />Linseed<br />Salt<br />Oat Fibre<br />Sesame<br />Yeast<br /><br />It is mentioned underneath the ingredients list that this bread containes Sesame.  Obviously, some people are allergic to sesame.  And, perhaps, some of the other ingredients?  Anyway, the ingredient list is above...and, of course, on each loaf wrapper.<br /><br />Also listed are special attributes of this bread:<br /><br />No preservatives<br />Kosher = K parev<br />High Fibre<br />Cholesterol Free<br />Natural Ingredients<br />Long Shelf Life<br />Wheat Free<br /><br />The second-to-the-last attribute, ""Long Shelf Life"" is due to the fact that THIS BREAD IS PASTEURIZED. (But, as mentioned above, it still tastes pretty good, unlike many other pasteurized products....)  The expiration date on the bread I have bought, is 12 - 12 - 2010 -- NINE MONTHS from the day I first opened the package, (YESTERDAY), and ate my first piece!<br /><br />Opened loaves, (there are 12 in the package), must be refrigerated, and eaten within 4 days.  But each loaf contains only 7 slices!  This makes it easy to eat the entire (nice and thinly-sliced) loaf in the required 4 days. It' interesting that there are SEVEN pieces in each loaf.  Usually, of course, it takes TWO pieces of any type of bread to make a sandwich.....<br /><br />But this bread is NOT shaped square-ishly, like most American breads.  No, as can clearly be seen from the photos here, it is RECTANGULARLY shaped.  This would seem to make it easy to simply slice the bread in half, and make a small sandwhich from the two pieces.  However, the texture of this bread will not allow this. Or, at least the texture of the bread I bought will not allow this.  As I said, the bread I have has a shelf-life of NINE months (left?).  I have no idea how long the bread's shelf-life is, when it first is baked.  IF it is one year, than I am missing three months -- and the bread, though fresh(ish?) is very, (very) slightly brittle. As a single-slice, it breaks off neatly, but if I was to try to cut it in half, and make a sandwich, I'm sure many, many crumbs would result.  Maybe this would happen even if the bread were at its freshest: the picture on the wrapper shows an OPEN-FACED sandwich ""serving suggestion"", using only one piece of bread....<br /><br />Or perhaps, because of the ALL-natural ingredients, no ""dough conditioners"" or other ingredients to make the bread soft enough to ""fold"", as most American breads do.  I wish a natural dough-conditioner, (or other ingredient), could be found, so that this fine, natural bread, would be as pliable as American breads are.<br /><br />I guess this ""unfoldability"" is my main complaint about this bread, and why I give it only 4 stars.  It is, however, quite good tasting, (minus the American-type sweetness I, personally, so enjoy), and it does make one feel good that one is NOT eating wheat, and is enjoying all-natural ingredients, and a high-fibre content, whilst eating this tasty bread!",0

282783,Lalita Tawjareon,5,1309651200,One of the Best Coffees by one of the Nicest Coffee Companies,"Out of all the coffee companies out there, I've probably been the most loyal to Millstone Coffee Company. Since 2001, I've been drinking Millstone Coffee Company coffees. In my opinion, they're honestly one of the nicest companies out there. In 2001, one of the few and rare times I entered an online contest/sweepstakes, I won second prize in Millstone's ""Gourmet Getaway Weekend"" sweepstakes. They gave me a Capresso Coffee Grinder and a package of their Foglifter coffee. I still have that Capresso Coffee Grinder in my kitchen. Honestly, Millstone's coffees do stand out. They're smooth, rich-tasting, and bold. And you truly get what you pay for with these coffee products. My co-workers and I have tried the majority of their products over the years ranging from Chocolate Velvet, Foglifter, French Vanilla, French Roast, Kona Blend, Caramel Truffle, Hazelnut Cream, Pumpkin Spice, etc. Millstone Coffee Company stay very true to the flavors they advertise on their coffee products. When you buy their Caramel Truffle - you taste the caramel. When you buy their Hazelnut Cream - you taste the hazelnut. When you buy their Pumpkin Spice - you taste the pumpkin. And of course, when you buy their Chocolate Velvet - you taste the chocolate. My co-workers and I have tried many coffees from many coffee brands over the years. And out of all the coffees out there that advertise ""chocolate"" flavor - Millstone, according to my opinion and my co-workers' opinions, are truly the most honest in advertising their ""chocolate"" flavor. You really do taste the chocolate in their Chocolate Velvet coffee. For example, I bought a bag of Godiva Chocolatier's Chocolate Truffle coffee a few months ago, and my co-workers and I were honestly very disappointed each time we made Godiva Chocolatier's Chocolate Truffle coffee. It didn't matter how strong we made the coffee - we didn't taste chocolate at all. My family, co-workers, and I think that Godiva Chocolatier make excellent and innovative chocolate candies and baked goods. I also think that Godiva Chocolatier's Lady Godiva 2011 mug they're currently selling online by New York artists Kurt Huggins and Zelda Devon is a beautiful and unique mug that many coffee drinkers would like to add to their coffee mug/tea cup collection. In my honest opinion, that Lady Godiva 2011 mug screams ""Lady Gaga"", and if I met Lady Gaga I would definitely give her that Lady Godiva 2011 mug as a gift because that mug just reminds me of her and I know that Lady Gaga loves all things New York-related, and New York-based designers created that mug. Really, I think that the Godiva Chocolatier company should send Lady Gaga that mug along with some of their hot chocolate. Anyways, if you want my complete honesty, if there is any Godiva Chocolatier product that needs improvement, it's their coffee. Really, out of all the companies out there, my co-workers and I thought that Godiva Chocolatier would make the best chocolate-flavored coffee, but it ends up that Millstone Coffee Company make the best chocolate-flavored coffee. Who knew? My verdict: Millstone Coffee Company make the best chocolate-flavored coffee - Chocolate Velvet. In general, they are truly one of the best coffee companies out there. And I hope that the Millstone Coffee Company make more flavored coffees in the future. To Millstone Coffee Company, if you're reading this - My co-workers and I have drank your coffees for more than a decade now. We have tried almost every coffee you have produced and made. We want more! Please make some new flavored coffees - we would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!",1

The other always vomits ten minutes after eating, no matter what she eats: canned or dried makes no difference and I've tried every store brand there is.  Hairball treatments had no effect.  I figured ""cats throw up"" and didn't worry about it.  When I moved and switched vets the new vet asked if the cats ever threw up.  When she heard about the one cat she said cats do NOT just throw up and told me to get the Science Diet sensitive stomach food.  Yes, it's 4x the price of what I'd been buying, but I noticed a difference with the first bowl.  Instead of throwing up ten minutes after literally every meal, now she throws up maybe once a month.  If only I'd switched to this brand years ago we both would have been saved a lot of misery.  Even tho it costs more I've noticed that the bag seems to last longer than the same amount of cat chow did.",1

It still came through loud and clear.  I had assumed they were safe to eat, as they didn't smell rancid, and the smell wasn't one I would associate with mold or mildew, but just a smell that I really don't like (no offense to sheep, but I just don't like that sheepy-wooly smell)...<br />Also, these Cashews do not have an origin on the bag or label.  A friend had just alerted me to controversy regarding cashew harvest and processing in Vietnam, so I was curious to see where these came from...  (you can use a search engine for 'Blood' Cashews for more information)<br />I'm disappointed.

429252,Jill B. Stuart,5,1350864000,Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!,"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.",1

It is astounding to me that the brown rice syrup is not regularly being tested by Nature's one because he FDA does not have any firm standards for arsenic.  What a cop out.  This is completely irresponsible considering its the main ingredient.  I did a lot of research before feeding this to my child and wanted to believe that this was the best formula out there but I feel like we have been let down.  I guess I have to rethink that idea that anything labeled ""organic"" is made with purest, ethical ingredients.

I thought from the reviews - so many, that these would be different than all the other natural, allergy free, gluten free, wheat free blah blah blah that I've tried.  When there's one or two 5 star/4 star on this kind of product I don't order it because I chalk it up to either people who never enjoyed ""fully loaded food"" but have always been limited in diet and so in comparison to the other choices, they probably are good - or people like some I know who really don't care about taste, as long as it says the right thing on the package, they think it's great.  Me, I've been modifying my diet relatively recently (a few years) due to severe allergies that literally make me feel like I might not recover from the reaction to some foods I have always eaten.  Everything I eat since this started is like a cross your fingers and hope it's ok, pray while I suffer through a reaction and be thrilled when it's over, or add to the list of food I can still eat and do the ""I can eat it "" dance. Certain preservatives are a huge culprit but so are other things so it's always a test.  I thought maybe I found one of those nothing bad in it foods that I could tolerate and would taste good.  These are terrible -I won't know until tomorrow if I can  tolerate them but it doesn't matter, I didn't even want to finish the first cookie.  They deserve a star for being soft-that's rare in low allergen foods.  But they don't taste anything like a snickerdoodle, they taste like a day old bran muffin with cinnamon on top and you can absolutely tell that they are ""nothing in it"" food - if not while eating it (which is obvious to me) the after taste is an absolute giveaway, just like all the rest.  The only decent thing beyond soft is a little cinnamon taste but that can't overcome the non-sweet sweeteners that curse all allergy free products in my opinion and nothing can help the grainy texture.  I'm truly heartbroken. I want a DECENT sweet that is safe! These are so grainy, cakelike but dry - not like a glass of milk could cure it dry - just grainy dry - must be the flaxseed. It's better than some products I've tried but not edible-at least not as long as I can eat other foods.  My experience with allergy free food has not been the greatest so I try everything I can and some foods that are not free of everything are tolerated while some foods that are everything free can still give me a reaction, just less likely so I'd rather have low risk experimental food-it's just such a bummer when they aren't any good.

I'm 90-100lbs overweight.  I love food especially fast food because cooking is not fun for me.  It is not uncommon for me to eat fast food at the very least once a day.  I didn't notice the first two days but day three I was debating what to eat for dinner and realized I couldnt decide which fast food place I wanted to drive though because I wasn't even hungry or craving anything to decide.  Then the next day it happened again, and the next.  Today is Sunday and usually the weekends I just want to eat everything because I have nothing else to do but watch tv and eat out of boredom or for flavor.  I now actually have to tell myself to eat. Believe me, I LOVE food.  I eat for flavor.  Now suddenly I don't even care to eat.  Maybe its mental but I've never not been hungry.  So after going nearly all day without wanting to eat.  Crazy, I know, I finaly made up my mind to go get a chicken sandwich from BK.  I made it half way and actualy put the other half down.  Never in my life have I stopped eating at the first sign of fullness.  Thats just a small part of my weight issues.  I have to clean the plate. Thats when I knew I had to write a review.  I drank it plain and its not that bad.  But I suggest drinking it with orange juice.  I don't even notice it.  It doesn't change the flavor at all.  Just the color of the orange juice changes a bit.

10005,Vladimir Dyo,1,1231804800,Constipation!!!!!,"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""<br /><br />  ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool.

I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.",0

It has a nice smell and flavor that makes me feel cozy. Some reviewers would say that this coffee is bitter. I would disagree.

Also shipped really well so there is no worry about breakage. I've never tried the Hot sauce, but since I'd be the only one eating it I can't see just buying one jar. Texture, taste, and flavor is just wonderful, on pasta, and some meat and chicken dishes. Manga! :)",1

These have no sugar. JACKPOT!<br /><br />I searched quite a while to find a treat/snack/dessert that I could enjoy on my diet and my once-sugar-addict hubby could enjoy so he doesn't feel deprived. I do carb controlled ""Primarian"" type dieting (mostly protein and veggies, with some cheese/yogurt, fruit and nuts/nut butters, no sugar (rarely, anyway), no gluten. I've given up most grains and have lost 110 lbs. Hubby is nearly underweight eating this way, so he gets extra snacks/treats.) So, I really had a hard time finding certain convenient (ie, I don't have to make it!) dessert items. These cookies solved my dilemma.<br /><br />I like the Orange Ginger Chocolate best, followed by the Island Lime. I found the peanut butter ones had a weird oily flavor. My super picky hubby likes the Cinni-Apple Spice. We've reordered these multiple times in the last few months, usually 4 or 6  bags at a time of EACH the three flavors. It gets really expensive, but it consolidates shipping. At 2 to 3 cookies at a time as a post-dinner or post-lunch dessert, it keeps me sane. Seriously, while I love fruit for dessert, sometimes, I just want me something that TASTES like I'm having pure old-fashioned junk. :D<br /><br />The texture is the only thing that could be improved on my fave two flavors. (I find the Cinni-Apple spice fine, but blander than I prefer, hence my preference for the others.) Some batches are nicely crispy. Others are chewy and stuck-together. I think they don't handle transport in the summer heat too well or the moisture levels in summer, cause my order earlier in the year were much nicer (ie, during the cooler/drier months). But even with the chewier texture and less crispness the flavor shines.<br /><br />Island Lime is mis-named. They should just call it Coconut Citrus. It's mostly coconut. It tasted 90% coconut to me with a hint of the citrus. Suits me fine. I adore coconut cookies (ie, the old sugary ones I used to get). So, if you expect heavy lime, sorry. If you love coconut, go for it. I judge most items I buy by the first five ingredients. Sure, the others count, but those are the BULK of what makes a lot of items, so here goes for Island Lime: Almonds, whey protein concentrate, unsweetened coconut, egg whites, vegetable fiber.  Very low-carb friendly stuff. It's 79 calories per serving of 2 cookies, 4 grams of fiber, 1 sugar, and 2 grams of protein.<br /><br />My fave, the Orange Ginger Chocolate taste like a bit of chocolate met a bit of Cointreau and had a baby. It's not a heavy choco taste. It's not really all that gingery. Just a bit. And the citrus reminds me of my earlier years when I sipped Cointreau at parties. Same texture issues, but the taste is a treat to me with coffee. Really satisfies. The nutritional profile didn't please me as much as the Island Lime, but hey, you sometimes just need that treat. First Five: Almonds, Whey protein concentrate, egg whites, vegetable fiber, maltodextrin.  It's 74 calories for 2 cookies (an acceptable amount on my 1200 to 1400 calorie diet), and it has 3 grams of fiber,  1 sugar, and 3 grams of protein per serving.<br /><br />I don't get intestinal distress like I do with some low-carb/diet stuff with sugar substitutes, which is another bonus. And the fiber content pleases me, too.<br /><br />If you miss having cookie on your diet and need to avoid gluten, here ya go. Enjoy.<br /><br />I would note that Netrition has a better price on these and reasonable shipping. Wish Amazon would stock and sell these. I order these a lot and it would save me loads to get it on my Prime list of items. Oh, well. Worth trying, no matter the vendor.",0

The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?",0

137590,pnr,5,1255132800,A lifesaver especially for cats with skin allergies,"We have been feeding our cat mixed canned food and dry (but more of the wet food). She was with Core Wellness Chicken Grain-Free until she had her dental surgery (with tooth extraction and cleaning), and the vet suspected that the antibiotic prescribed caused her to itch all over after a week into recovery. She started to lick and pull her hair with her teeth, as well as excessively lick her legs, paws, back, belly and the scratching was constant. Our poor baby! The Core wellness was good but the vet told us we need rabbit meal or rabbit canned food for our cat to itch less and to rule out allergy from chicken or fish. We got this Nature's Variety dry food (still has chicken) to supplement the rabbit canned food, which is her main food now. She has to have the dry food to snack on otherwise she would not eat the wet food. And she is normally an active cat.<br /><br />It has been 3 days since we changed her diet and we can see remarkable improvements - less scratching, and she's more active and playing and much happier now! We observed that our cat has been drinking more with this food, which makes perfect sense from another person's review and from the package label. It says it has only 10% moisture. By the way, our cat is pretty much healthy prior to her dental procedure, no kidney problems, not diabetic, no hyperactive thyroidism thank goodness. And she has her complete blood profile done before and after the dental surgery. All other organs tested as well. We ruled out flea allergies since we have her on a flea prevention monthly maintenance(Revolution, update: changed to Advantage II) which we apply on her every month since we got her.<br /><br />So if your cat is scratching excessively with generalized itching on the body, and pulling hair (no vomiting, diarrhea etc. just the scratching,excessive licking and hair-pulling) like our cat, it may be skin allergy .. this cat food proved to be helpful to us. It's definitely a lifesaver for our precious cat. We wish to continue using this product as well as the canned rabbit food to keep our cat healthy and itch-free!",1

343250,zooz,5,1298592000,Objective & Subjective (from a particular buyer),"This review is for the 24 pack of 3 Oz. cans of the Wellness Brand Cat Food.<br /><br />Objectively speaking...<br />The cans are easy to ope and they have consistently arrived in excellent condition.  There are 24 cans at 3 oz. each.  That's all I can really say objectively about cat food.<br /><br />Subjectively speaking...<br />I could not believe the difference in my cats after switching to a canned cat food from dry food.  My cats are 15 and 16 years old.  They are healthy indoor cats who are still active and playful with no real health problems aside from my 16 year old cat having minor diabetes.  I had been feeding a high priced prescription (vet recommended) dry food for the last 2 years only to have my 15 year old cat begin getting sick and regurgitating his food on a weekly basis.  I took my cat to the vet repeatedly asking why this might be a problem.  The vet simply told me that the cat may be a little under the weather or it was hairball related...which before had not been an issue.  After a conversation with a friend in Dec 2010 they emphatically recommended canned cat food.  I decided to do some research and was I glad that I did.  My cats have been eating canned food for 2 months now and here are the changes I've noticed.  My cat who was throwing up 2-4 times a week has only done so 4 times in 2 months (and I think that was because he was biting at some straw that I didn't know about), their fur is ridiculously softer...like I just spent an hour brushing them, now it feels that way all the time.  And although my cats are not prone to hairballs, my medium haired cat would get them on occasion and he has had only 1 very small one in 2 months as opposed to the weekly ones I'd find in the house.  They have more energy and they just seem happier in how they interact and the littler box has less to be cleaned up and quite frankly it smells less offensive than it did before.  Don't get me wrong...cat boxes smell but I've been told (and now I feel I can attest to this) that dry food would dehydrate a cat and it would enter a system and absorb odors from the body and carry them out into the cat box to amplify the foul odors.  Actual cat food like the Wellness brand (not many brands are grain or rice free)  gets more fully digested by the cat and does not contain grains and rices and other fillers that are expelled with the body.  I must say that I felt the fool not having taken more time to learn about the diet possibilities of my cats.<br /><br />I will note that I also use the Wellness dry food (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup out each night) for my 2 cats to eat between their canned meals.  This is also to keep them used to eating a little dry food in case I am in a situation where I cannot provide their can in the morning and night.  For your reference I feed my cats each 1/2 a can in the morning and 1/2 in the evening (so 2 cans total daily).  I am going to switch to the 12 oz cans though because they are much cheaper, you nearly double your canned food for the same price, I'm just going to buy a resealable lid and scoop out what is needed.<br /><br />And as a side note, my cats eat most of the food when I leave it out but they do not finish it all.  I do leave the food out for them to finish up which they usually do within 1-3 hours.  Some people say you should never do this, some say they will leave it out all day...in my experience over the 2 months I have noticed no mold, illness or rejection of this food being left out for a few hours for my cats.  The longest I've seen food remain in the is at the 7 hour mark and still, it was finished with no negative behaviors or effects noticed in either of my animals.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you and please be aware specifically of what goes into certain brands.  There are cheaper canned foods but they are not as good as this brand.  I've checked and tried a few.  This one is really different.  There are a few websites which explain the health benefits more precisely and if you won't take my word for it on this brand see for yourself.  Also, the cost is well worth the response you will get from your cat and when measured against prescription dry food it really hasn't been much different and the 12 oz sizes will make it even more affordable.  Be good to yourself and your pets!",1

96893,nardfran,1,1346025600,Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!,"I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!",0

176301,ampyun@hotmail.com,5,1286841600,Great for the health conscious and tasty too!,"I ordered this and have enjoyed eating it over the past few months. The ingredients are very healthy and pure, and best of all i love how simple they are! I am very health conscious, and avoid high fructose corn syrup found in most store bought breads. This bread has great ingredients, and not a very high sugar content either. I compared the ingredients to all the other bread mixes i could possibly find on the internet.. well, i spent all day researching, and I didn't like how others had high sugar contents (such as the number 3 ingredient being 'cane sugar' or the number 4 and 5 ingredients being sugar and brown sugar, etc). I also wanted a bread packed with whole grains, and 9 grain is great!<br /><br />And of course i looked for something easy on the wallet. I originally made my own bread and tried buying whole grain flours from health food stores but i just couldn't match 9 grains, and it got pricey. Obviously just plain white flour bread making will be cheaper than buying this boxed stuff, but i wanted whole grain bread. It turned out to be difficult exactly comparing the price of this compared with baking from scratch since all the flours are by the ounce, etc, but i decided that this price is very good. Compared to other brands of bread mix, this price is pretty much the lowest I have found with the free shipping.<br /><br />In terms of taste, honestly I really don't care as long as it's healthy, I will basically like it or learn to like it, but I will say that I love the taste of this bread and have been making sandwiches almost every weekday for the past couple months. If I want to be real nit-picky i would say the milled flaxseed SLIGHTLY gives it a bad smell, but its subtle and overall the bread still tastes great. Besides, its super healthy! I should also mention that I bake this bread using a very nice bread maker, so I would take that under consideration when reading this review. And for those that care, I bake it with some earth balance butter substitute. Lastly, if your bread is coming out a little dense, add more water and yeast and it will come out great! If you need to spice it up you can throw in some dried cherries and/or walnuts, and other things I'm sure will work too I'm sure. It was even more delicious when I did this.",1

I had packed my special blend of homemade Bloody Mary fixin's to enjoy in our Hotel.  Unfortunately,  this time I included ""Dave's Insanity Sauce"" which I had unwittingly bought for my husband who likes it hot.  Once we hit our room I made two potent Mary's & not knowing what to expect barely dipped toothpick in  Insanity Sauce & swirled it into my  cocktail.<br />Immediately  upon my 1st sip FLAMES began shooting though my left ear ""CARTOON STYLE""...<br />It hurt so bad I thought I was going to have to go to E.R. Nearly ruined my entire weekend... On our last day in Monterey we found this little shop called Slow Burn (alas no longer open) which was packed to the brim with hot sauces from all over..

Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know. I won't be ordering this size again in the future, and will just make the one hour trip to my grocer that carries the larger size and then buy locally in bulk next time.<br /><br />Note: if you try the product it is really good, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.",0

However, I have been disappointed with the Senseo coffee pods that are made in Belgium by Douwe Egberts. The pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh. The pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak, watery brew. The flavored Senseo French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee Pods seem to me to be better than most Senseo blends that I have tried. In general, I prefer to buy pods from Timothy's World Coffee. The Timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the Senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior, in my view. I have found that the Timothy pods will work well in the Senseo machine if the pod is moistened and smoothed before latching the lid. I use the single pod holder and make a 4 ounce cup. If you must use the Senseo pods made by Douwe Egberts, try this blend.",0

I first started using this years ago when it was available in the supermarkets.  It was a much smaller size and similar seasonings were available for steaks, salad and seafood.  When the local stores stop selling it, I continued to look and luckily found it on Amazon around 4 years ago.<br /><br />This seasoning is very versatile.  It is not salty and and brings a nice flavor to many items.  For some dishes it is the only seasoning used.  I have used it on seafood like shrimp or catfish. We season our pork roast with it (forms a nice crust) and of course poultry. It does not go well with everything because it is a course seasoning.  But there are several dishes that you will enjoy using it for.<br /><br />For our home, we use a bottle of this every 9 months or so.  So be sure to check the expiration date on the bottle when you get it.

224184,Sinister Stairs,5,1277424000,"Our favorite puppy toy, and arguably second-best investment we made!","We absolutely love the Buster Cube, as does our dog Jack!  This is easily our favorite toy of his, and arguably the second best item we've bought for him (his crate being #1).<br /><br />When we first got the Buster Cube, it distracted him for 30 minutes at a time.  Not only does it challenge his mind, but it forces him to eat slower so he digests better.  We pretty much put his entire dinner in there now!<br /><br />He loves the cube as well, and views it as a treat now, in and of itself!  (i.e. He'll ""beg"" for it, and even roll it around when there's no treats in it.)<br /><br />Since then he's gotten much faster at getting the food out, so we have been slowly dialing up the difficulty.  (There is a dial that increases/decreases the food reservoir.)<br /><br />Some tips:  It's really noisy if your dog plays with it on tiling, and it slides around more than it rolls.  So if the noise bothers you or if you want to make it easier for your dog, have hir play with it on carpeting.<br /><br />Also, it helps to play with it in an area where the cube won't accidentally roll underneath dressers or down the stairs or get wedged into a corner.  (Although, through these kinds of mistakes, Jack has figured out how to avoid them.)<br /><br />The most important thing, as mentioned in the included instructions, is to make make sure your dog quickly gets food out of it and realizes there's more to be had. Even the very first time we tried the Buster Cube, Jack was completely focused and involved. :)<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />We've had this over a month now, and now the full-size Buster Cube is our favorite -- our dog outgrew the mini as his meals got bigger and it took longer and longer for us to pack them into the mini.<br /><br />If we ever got another puppy, I'd also use the small-sized Cube in between the mini and the large.  The Cubes are awesome, but let them grow with your pet. :)",1

I have a 13 pound Chug (pug chihuahua mix) and I buy the large then cut them into 2 or 3 long pieces. At first I gave her the Enzymatic chew which lasted her a whole day or even two which is good because she usually goes threw chew treats within an hour. Then I gave her the HEXtra chew to try and she loves this one. Most of the pieces are thinner but still last a good day of chewing. I cant even get within 2 feet of her before she starts growling then she just runs away with it lol. I find that most of the chews for the HEXtra are much thinner and easier to cut with basic scissors. For the Enzymatic half the time I have to use a knife to cut it. After she had a taste of the HEXtra she slowly steers away from the Enzymatic each time we give her one. After 2 weeks whenever we give her the Enzymatic she just licks it a couple times and then walk away. For the HEXtra she still goes crazy over them! She goes through all the tricks I taught her without saying the commands lol. I dont know what the big health difference between the HEXtra and Enzymatic but if I had to recommend one I would suggest getting the HEXtra. Hands down your dog will love it. Now im stuck with a big bag of CET Enzymatic that my dog no longer likes because she prefers the HEXtra.

I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.

In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products.",0

A couple of Vets said it looked like Staph and we tried SEVERAL rounds of antibiotics and medicated shampoos. None of them worked.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

Now the boys `round these parts reely lak this chili bettrn the red sissy chili. Most the womens think the green's a little hot fer thur sweet lips.""<br /><br />Taste Test:<br /><br />Without all of the boring details, we followed the enclosed directions to the letter, adding ground beef to keep the initial batch as simple as possible. It smelled good as it was cooking, but we had to increase the cooking time, simmering it gently for an extra hour as it was a little flat. Let's just say that it was disappointing, and that's an understatement. For the next attempt, we tried the time tested method of cooking the chili the day before, letting it cool down, then refrigerating the batch overnight to give all the flavors time to blend. That was a very slight improvement, but not by much. Let's just say that it was reminiscent of some chili that I once had at an obscure New Jersey diner that's no longer in business. There never was a third attempt.<br /><br />Sometimes it's just better to do it yourself. This is the recipe that I use for ""DIY Slow Cooked Chili"" that I learned years ago when living in the South, and the one that I fall back on when in the mood for cooking:<br /><br />* 2 lb. ground beef<br />* 1 1/2 cups chopped onions<br />* 1/2 cup chopped green pepper<br />* 2 garlic cloves, finely cut (not chopped)<br />* 28 oz. can whole tomatoes<br />* 2 (16 oz.) cans kidney beans<br />* 2 tbsp. chili powder<br />* 2 tsp. salt<br />* 2 tsp. cumin<br />* 2 tsp. black pepper<br /><br />Brown the ground beef; add onions, green pepper, garlic, tomatoes, kidney bens, salt, chili powder, pepper and cumin in a slow cooker or crock pot. Cover and simmer on low setting for 6 to 8 hours. Makes 8 to 10 servings. Serve with cornbread and whatever hot sauce you like. Looking forward to trying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008JHROIM"">Tabanero Hot Sauce Picante</a>, as it's been highly recommended.<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />This company also makes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007680BD0"">Redneck Chill E SPICY</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00767OJDO"">Redneck Habanerah Allives</a> (you'll just have to look at that one), but to date this reviewer has resisted the temptation to try either of these or their other offerings. However, I did receive a box of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7F8G"">Leonard Mountain 3 Amigos Enchilada Stew</a> as a gift from a friend, and this product was easily worth a 5-star recommendation. That was one of the reasons that I tried their chili mix. Go figure.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Cannot say that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7DTC"">Leonard Mountain Boot Scootin' Green Chile Chili</a> was the worst chili mix that I've ever had, but it's probably borderline close. What one pays for here is cute slogans and clever packaging, and this product is highly overpriced for what you get. Sad to say, even those chili seasoning packets you find in the spice section of your grocery store are better. But the burlap bag packaging was clever, and my son kept the miniature Tabasco green pepper sauce bottle, so I'll give it one star each for the creative packaging and the tiny Tabasco bottle.<br /><br />9/4/2012",0

I have yet to find even one that looks normal and didn't have some gray on it.<br /><br />What causes chocolate to become gray?<br /><br />""Sugar bloom is normally caused by surface moisture. The moisture causes the sugar in the chocolate to dissolve. Once the moisture evaporates, sugar crystals remain on the surface. If this process is repeated, the surface can become sticky and even more discolored. Although sugar bloom is most often the result of overly humid storage, it can happen when the chocolate has been stored at a relatively cool temperature and is then moved too quickly into much warmer surroundings. When this happens, the chocolate sweats, producing surface moisture.<br /><br />Fat bloom is similar to sugar bloom, except that it is fat or cocoa butter that is separating from the chocolate and depositing itself on the outside of the candy. As with sugar bloom, the most common causes of fat bloom are quick temperature changes and overly-warm storage.<br /><br />Although it might look a little less appetizing than a lustrous, rich chocolatey-brown piece of candy, chocolate that has suffered bloom is still okay to eat. You may find the texture of sugar-bloomed chocolate to be a bit grainy on the outside, but it should still taste good. To prevent this from happening to your chocolate, simply use proper storage methods.""<br /><br />Guess I'll be returning this.",0
232329,Richie,5,1344470400,So Good!,"I never really liked cup noodles or bowl noodles. To me they have always tasted too plain and lacked flavor. One day my mom bought one of this product for me and told me to try it because her friend's son loves it. I was hesistant at first due to my prior experiences, but I decided to give it a shot anyways. First Impression ""WOW!"", and I am glad to say now I am an addict. This bowl noodle is of high quality, even if the price is low. The seasoning that is supplied, is so delicious. It is spicy, but not to the point where you will be tearing, it is just enough to give you a kick. My favorite part is the soup, it's spicy and has an amazing taste and I just cannot get enough of it. The bowl however comes with a lot of noodles, so if your not a fan of the soup you will still have a lot of noodles to munch on and after 1 bowl it should fill you up, but I am warning you now that everytime you have one of these your going to want another one right away. Overall, amazing product and I eat this very often. I usually buy it from my local grocery since it costs about 88cents per bowl and I don't have to wait for shipping.<br /><br />Just some additional information on how to prepare:<br /><br />Microwave<br />1- Open Lid halfway and fill up the bowl with water (about 3/4).<br />2 - Open the seasoning package, and pour it all in the bowl.<br />3 - Mix it up, cover the lid, and then put it in the microwave for 3 minutes.<br />4 - Once timer is up, let it sit in the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes and your ready to go!<br /><br />Boiling Water<br />1 - Boil Water<br />2 - Open Lid half way, and then open the seasoning package and pour everything in.<br />3 - Pour the boiling water into the bowl (about 3/4)<br />4 - Let it sit for about 2-3 minutes and your ready to go!<br /><br />Fun Fact - The longer you let the noodles sit in the hot water with the lid covered, the more water it will absorb, and it will lead to the noodles being thicker! So if your someone who prefers more noodles than soup, let it sit for about 5-6 minutes before you start munching.<br /><br />Let me know if my review helped!

They do not contain corn or wheat, which is good because he seems to get itchy when he eats those grains.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could not give them to our other dog, a beagle mix. He tends to get seizures after he consumes chicken, and since these contain natural chicken flavor, I did not risk giving him these.<br /><br />I received these treats as a sample. I would not bother to purchase them because of the cost plus the fact that only one of my pets can eat them.<br /><br />I wonder if the price would be lower if designer nutrients were left out. I mean, do dogs naturally want green tea extract? I realize that studies are being done on possible benefits of this substance, but throwing some in dog treats is not the same as having a vet prescribe it. When I searched the web for research on canine green tea extract, one of the first that came up reported that some beagles died in a study using high doses of the extract, so now I feel that caution may be advisable. Of course, your dog would have to eat an awful lot of these treats to get enough of it to suffer any harm; a single treat is almost certainly okay.<br /><br />Nutraceuticals have become trendy because marketers know that people are aware that certain nutrients have impressive health benefits. And including these nutrients give manufacturers a reason to charge more. You may want to ask your vet's opinion before paying extra for designer treats.",0

The one very odd thing is that many people are eating SOY products even though it has been proven over and over again that Soy products or non fermented soy, are very bad for you.  It has been proven that they even cause you to not be able to properly digest other foods you are eating alongside it let alone the fact that soy by itself is actually bad for you in most incantations.<br /><br />Soy ingredients are almost always bad.  TOFU for example is indigestible for the most part.  Did you know there is strong evidence showing that soy leads to Alzheimer's disease.  What a horror to learn this.  It is the GMO created soy by Monsanto that does this and of course they deny it all.  They create poison and companies keep buying it because the government was paid off to put their stamp on it and stamp it they do even though it has been proven that it is poison.  NICE RIGHT?<br /><br />Here Read this great article.  Alzheimer's caused by Soy product<br /><br />Here is a great link<br />[...]<br /><br />Read the link as it explains it best.

I love 3 year old Miso from South River a US based ancient method maker of Miso and genuine Tamari.<br /><br />So just be very very careful before jumping into any of these products.  I also love HEMP but I know nothing about the feasibility of eating it to get the protein from it.  Does hemp also have properties similar to soy in that the protein is difficult to access easily?  NO seems to be the answer.  Hemp is very safe and is the number one plant based protein.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The list from that link for good sources of protein<br /><br />Quality plant-based proteins include:<br /><br />  * Hemp protein (one of the most complete amino acid profiles of any plant-based protein)<br />  * Yellow pea protein<br />  * Brown rice protein<br />  * Flaxseed (also high in Omega-3s)<br />  * Chlorella (a microscopic, freshwater green algae from Japan - my favourite is Chloressence)<br />  * Almonds, other nuts and seeds (preferably sprouted, since sprouting pre-digests the proteins in seeds, making the amino acids more available to your body)<br />  * Legumes<br />  * Pseudograins (including quinoa and buckwheat)<br /><br />GOOD LUCK",0

I've tried many brands over the years.<br /><br />I used to stick with good old Twinings, but they seem to have changed their UK Earl Grey flavour in the last few years (it's now less appealing to me) and their US Earl Grey flavour is different (and inferior, in my opinion) to their UK Earl Grey flavour.

I myself live for hot sauce so have probably developed a tolerance of some sort. This sauce is indeed HOT. If you are not a consistent hot sauce user of hotter variety then this will be most likely hot for you. But if you are like me and order the hottest wings or the spiciest dishes or enjoy true hot flavor then this will most likely be a 7 out of 10 on the hot scale.

I used to have my own retail shop and I actually put in refrigerated cases and storage in order to import this line from Belgium.  I was a candy/gourmet buyer for 16 years.  When I bought Gudrun for resale, they were so concerned about quality control that I was told by the vendor in order to make the mocha cream for the Zebra piece, they bought the coffee beans, had their own grinding equipment and developed the chocolate from A to Z in house.  I had one customer come to my store before hurricane Kate, hoping to get a couple Zebras to get her through the storm.  So, not high school chocolate, which is waxy.  However, it is vital that this product be handled appropriately and not outdated.  Any chocolate, if mishandled and old, will not taste as the manufacturer intended.  If it has whitish discoloration on the surface, it has gone through a temperature flux, separating the oils.  Incidentally, the Zebra was my favorite.  Very hard to find now.  It was a mocha cream on a burned sugar/croquant base with white chocolate coating (yellowish-cream colored, very rich) and dark chocolate zig-zagged across the top to make the ""Zebra.""  Apparently now made in a dark chocolate as well.  HTH.",0

This one just wasn't that good for me.  And as a newly converted tea drinker, it's got to be good if it's going to keep me out of the soda aisle.<br /><br />The flavor was very very weak in this tea.  Which rather surprised me considering the ingredients in it.  I prepared it like all others, letting it steep for awhile in boiling hot water, but it didn't even give off the nice scent that most of Davidson's teas do at this point.  Sipping it I could taste the bitter aftertaste of the tea, but none of the other flavors were present and it just tasted like hot water.  I'd like to think that maybe it was just an old teabag, but it was freshly purchased and that didn't seem to be the case.<br /><br />The ingredients, like all Davidson's teas, were very good at least.  Organic Rooibos, peppermint, cinnamon, orange peel, lemon peel and natural flavors were the entire list.  And I am pleased that they attempted to use some organic products.  But as said before, with all the other flavors, it really surprised me that this tea was so weak.  I've had the rooibos tea in other mixtures and liked it, so I know it wasn't that I just didn't like this type of tea.<br /><br />Not my favorite for sure.  I will continue to enjoy my other Davidson's teas, but not this particular flavor.  The rest are being taken to work and tossed in the shared food pile in the hopes that someone else will like it more.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",0

341941,S. Stutzman,4,1278288000,Great compared to most (other instant coffees),"I won't bore you with what has already been said. This instant coffee is a pleasure to drink in comparsion with most instant or even regular drip coffees. It is smooth and creamy even if a little bland looking to the eye. Even the aftertaste is pleasant as it lingers in your mouth for quiet a while. I find that I have to use a double portion of the prescribed teaspoon of instant coffee to achieve a decent taste per cup. The price is reasonable and the taste good but let me share my reluctance.<br /><br />My only reluctance about this instant coffee is simply because I am a coffee snob. Starbucks VIA instant coffee is far better tasting instant with its only drawback being about $1 per cup. With a double portion of Mount Hagen instant coffee the price is about $0.25 a cup ($46 Amazon cost / 6 packs / 30 double servings per pack = ~$0.25) Furthermore, I wouldn't trade in my regular drip, french press, or chemex coffees for this instant as they are incomparable and an unfair comparsion.<br /><br />Now why would I dare to compare this instant to other ground coffees? Simply because other reviewers have posted saying Mount Hagen is as good as regular. Unless you're drinking Folgers, Maxwell House, or some other coffee made with ground tires and run through an old shoe, no, this instant is not as good. I would reach for a good coffee of drip coffee over this coffee any day of the week.<br /><br />But for what this instant is and the price, it is excellent. If you keep in mind that sometimes you only need one cup of coffee at night or on the go, you simply cannot lose with Mount Hagen's instant coffee. Again, it has an fantastic taste (for an instant) and won't break the bank. But don't expect this instant to knock your socks off either.",0

These bars are maybe 1 1/2"" wide, 4"" long, and 1/4"" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away.",0

Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I"">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y"">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the pât&eacute; kind, I.e. ""in meaty juices"" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based ""in meaty juices"" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft pât&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar ""in nearby juices"" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have.",1

However, commercial oats sold on the world market are extensively contaminated with gluten-containing wheat, rye and barley, and are therefore not suitable for a gluten-free diet - this includes grocery store oatmeal and products made with oats. However, in the past 8 or so years, oats have been grown in dedicated fields using scanned seeds, and the crop tested for gluten. These are known in the celiac world as ""gluten-free oats.""

When I brew 1.5 oz of these beans with 24 oz of water for no more than four minutes, this coffee turns out smooth and delicious.

The Creamy Peanut Butter has a nice, smooth and creamy texture, and a sweet, but not too sweet, flavor.

This would explain why there isn't testing as to the mercury levels -- b/c the omega-3 doesn't come from fish.

Once I realized they were plant based, I tried them again.  Strangely, now they taste fine to me.

27585,Sage Hill Roses,2,1342483200,"Not what it was cracked up to be, for me","I've used the European style drip sprouters by Bioset, now called the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N03EK0"">Victorio VKP1013 Round Three-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, for over ten years, with good results. There was room for improvement, but overall I was content enough with the experience to lead me to expand my sprouting adventure, and now I also grow micro-greens and baby greens in trays. When I decided to take the Bioset on an extended trip and it cracked (silly me), I thought I'd ""upgrade"" to this one, on the advice of one of the various sprouting websites out there, which maligned the Bioset-style sprouters and anyone benighted enough to rely on them. The Sprout Master was billed as the best sprouter in the world, a breeze to use, handy, yadda yadda yadda. The best thing since sliced (sprouted-grain) bread.<br /><br />This was not my experience. I guess it boils down to the fact that the set up is not much different than the drip style, with the exception of increased inconvenience. The Sprout Master requires hand rinsing the seeds and sprouts rather than the pour-and-drip system. This did not bother me in and of itself, however, as I enjoy the process of working with the seeds and sprouts as much as eating them. I was happy to put in more work for better results. Also, with this sprouter, you have to soak your seeds first, which the European style ones get around by taking advantage of the varying surface tension of the water of unsprouted and sprouted seeds. When they are unsprouted, a bit of the water sits in the trays, allowing a mini-soak. Once they sprout, more of the water continues its process from tray to tray to the receptacle. If you are really concerned about too much water sitting there (one of the complaints from the sprouting site), you just give it a few quick shakes, and off goes the water. Here, again, I was unperturbed: I like the process of nurturing my sprouts. Nevertheless, I began to wonder whether the results would be much improved.<br /><br />They weren't. It seems there are operational differences as well as the design distinctions. First, the holes for dripping, which I really did like at first to allow for good clean rinsing, are too large to hold alfalfa, mustard, and similar small seeds, even after soaking overnight. You lose even more as you rinse them for the first day or two. Then, unless you mist the seeds, rinsing tumbles them all around, in addition to pushing some through the holes in the early phase. This means that you don't get nice vertical sprouts unless you are uber-careful. Were that not enough, my first batch just got rotten, moldy, and nasty--something that has never happened to me in over a decade of using the drip sprouters. So I resolved to try again, thinking that maybe I didn't pay attention to placing the lids on properly (necessary in order to allow for air circulation). But first I had to pry sprout roots out of the holes without breaking the the sprouter (the build quality is not encouraging), and to poke out the seeds that had wedged into the holes when small and begun to grow, which I'd also never had to do with the drip sprouters. The second time around I got somewhat better results, but they still did not begin to compare to my standard Bioset crop, even ignoring the extra effort and loss of seeds. Far fewer seeds sprouted (and I'm using the same mix as ever), and they were a knotted mess. I could get equally uninspiring results from a mason jar and cheesecloth.<br /><br />Perhaps this sprouter does well with larger seeds or sprouts that you do not intend to grow vertically. It may be, too, that a little perseverance and a few good new tricks for the smaller seed crops would have made this sprouter useful to me, but I did not see the point. I knew I could do better, and the 30-day deadline for returns was glowering. So I sent it back, and am now trying Victorio's updated drip sprouter, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FVPP04"">Victorio VKP1014 4-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, which, though still not ideal, I much prefer to the Sprout Master. The new model is BPA free, made of crack-resistant plastic, does away with the little drain spigots of the previous version (an admitted nuisance), and comes with a lid you can use to store the sprouts in a tray in the fridge. At half the price of the Sprout Master. So far, my first set of sprouts (again, using the same mix) did just dandy, without loss of seeds, mold, rot, tumbled sprouts, marauding roots or seed-clogged holes. Plus it looks oh so pretty with the sprouts all green and alive and vertical in there. (The Sprout Master is opaque, so you can't see the sprouts once they've grown--nor would you necessarily want to, unless you have the patience to pamper your seeds so they grow vertically.)<br /><br />In sum, I really wanted to like this sprouter, and feel like a ""real"" kitchen gardener. But I just didn't. In the end, what sets a real gardener apart is a harvest, not a name brand.",0

I was buying the Campbell's Healthy Request Minestrone, which has just a little more sodium then this, and the difference is quite noticeable. But the texture of Amy's is not as watery, more like home made(although nothing's like homemade) and the veggies seem more like real veggies then Campbell's. It is packed with veggies and has a good portion of pasta as well, and with a little bread(low sodium/whole grain) it makes a great lunch.There are 2 servings per can, and the servings are a pretty generous size.<br /><br />There are other benefits to this soup beside the low-sodium.It is really nutritious. It is made with al Vegan/Organic ingredients,is very low fat, has NO cholesterol, and you just heat and serve.It's a good source of Vitamins A and C, and has some iron benefit as well. Unlike the condensed soups, no water is added. Also it is marked as Kosher.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Filtered Water,Organic Tomatoes,Organic Onions,Organic Carrots,organic Kidney Beans,Organic Potatoes,Organic Celery,organic Pasta(organic semolina flour),Organic Green Beans,Organic Peas,Organic Leeks,pure herbs and spices,Organic High Oleic Safflower and/or sunflower oil,Sea`Salt,Organic Garlic. It DOES contain Wheat(for those with allergies). The facility also processes milk, soy,tree nuts and seed products, however does not use any peanuts,fish,shellfish or eggs -(all from label)<br /><br />sodium per serving is 290mg,dietary fiber is 3 gm,sugar 5g and protein 3 g. total fat is 1.5g(no trans or saturated fat and carbs are 17g.<br /><br />I also think this 12 pack case is a really good buy. Even if you tried to make homemade soup-have you looked at the price of organic veggies these days.And don't think you will get bored with this, the case I received has a shelf life through jan 2011, so it's not like you have to eat it up all at once(but it is pretty good!) And by the way, my order shipped and arrived promptly.<br /><br />So remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy.........Laurie",1

276557,"Allen Smalling ""Constant Reader,""",4,1336348800,Nice flowers at a good price,"I've ordered ProFlowers tulips several times over the past few years and have been well satisfied with them.  As with any ProFlowers selection, they will arrive in a green box brought by a private carrier (UPS and others).  ProFlowers times these tulips (and most other bouquets) to arrive ""in bud form"" so don't despair if they look only partly open; that's how they are meant to look.  They will also be thirsty, so soak the stems in fresh water for a good many hours, recut them and arrange them in the vase with cold fresh water and the powdered floral extender provided.  You'll have the fun of watching them perk up and bloom over the next couple of days.  Tulips, alas, do not last as long as lillies or roses, but one way to keep the charm going is to cut the stems VERY short after a few days, when they start to flag, and put them in short container(s) like cubic vases or even votive-candle holders.  Don't forget to introduce the second packet of floral extender.<br /><br />Tulips are tricky little devils, being both phototropic and heliotropic (moving toward sun and any light).  Even the little seven-watt night light in my kitchen exerted enough of a pull that a whole bunch leaned toward it while soaking overnight.  The trick, as with a recalcitrant house pet, is to let the tulips think they're in control -- keep the retainer collar for the initial soak.  The included ""free"" clear glass vase is most likely a ginger-jar form and is well-suited for the tulips, which have the undeniable charm of being both rustic and severely elegant, and can look good in almost any kind of arrangement in almost any kind of setting.  I definitely think fifteen tulips (as pictured) is far preferable to a mere dozen, especially since classic floral composition is based on odd numbers, not even.  At the time of this writing (5-7-2012), nineteen ninety-nine for the bouquet is a very good price.  There is an extra charge for shipping, though, and possibly local tax.<br /><br />I can't help but notice that many of the negative reviews toward ProFlowers' bouquets are based on misunderstandings, especially from people who expected the flowers to look as fully formed (and arranged??) as they do in the publicity photos.  Amazon does not provide enough background information about the ProFlowers process, in my opinion, but you can scope that out by going to the proflowers dot com site and clicking on ""Flower Care"" below the featured offerings.  Once in a while you can get a better deal at that site, too.",0

Woo Hoo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, instead of using just apple juice, they threw in a little white grape juice and some lemon juice and the result is that flavor you get when you eat apple flavored Jolly Ranchers, chew apple gum, or any other kind of apple candy; that fake apple taste that to me is nothing like the taste of real apples.  I happen to despise that flavor.<br /><br />I still like the product and while my son loved the flavor, I found it only tolerable.  But on those special occasions when he is allowed a pop, I much rather give him this sparkling juice that he THINKS is a pop.<br /><br />And for me, I am not a big pop OR juice drinker, but I love fizzy waters, and this is a nice change of pace.

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward.",0

I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring!

387317,S. A. Brown,3,1340841600,Best beans for Jura S9: UPDATED,"I'm an espresso nut and have several machines that I call my friends. One of these is a Jura S9 Avantgarde, and after trying dozens and dozens of various beans to find the perfect mate, Intelligentsia Black Cat Classic prevailed as the very clear winner. There may be better beans out there, but not for this machine. I've served thousands of shots of this espresso out of the Jura, and everyone is impressed by it... actually, not just impressed... blown away. It's not uncommon to have neighbors coming in the back door in the morning to grab a shot. This bean produces a perfect espresso... great crema, thick legs... smooth with no bitterness and a slight nut/chocolate finish. The best thing is the consistency... the beans are always the same... which is not true of so many other small producers. It's also great in cappuccini, macchiati, etc.<br /><br />I live very close to Intelligentsia in LA and buy beans there in person... but, my other house is 2 hours away... and when there, I order these beans online through Amazon. These mail order ones are fine... and are very similar to what you get in the store. It is a serious downer that Intelligentsia switched the size from 16oz to 12oz, which essentially upped the price by about 30%... but, it's still much cheaper than Illy or some others.<br /><br />When you buy in the store, the beans have usually been roasted only a few days before. From Amazon, it seems to be about  2 weeks... something like that. To be honest, it really doesn't make much difference... since the beans are whole and sealed, the taste between beans that are a few days from roasting versus 2 weeks is virtually indiscernible. If the beans were 1 day old versus a month or so, there would be a slight difference, but here... there's nothing really worth mentioning... and certainly nothing to prevent me from ordering them. There's lot of hype about this... but...<br /><br />As an aside, I much prefer these Classic beans to the Organic beans. The Classic seem to produce better crema, have less bitterness and less of the bright-forward flavor I try to avoid.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/30/2012: Purchased again from Amazon and the beans were about 2 months old. That's really pushing the limits of acceptability... probably will not order from Amazon again. Changed from 5 stars to 3.",0

435250,SteFlow,2,1293235200,Not the most versatile spaghetti,"This spaghetti makes for some good food, but it certainly doesn't make the best shoes. I was advised to buy this specific spaghetti (De Cecco) along with a chocolate shoe mold (which doubles as a real shoe mold) in order to make my own shoes. After successfully crafting the shoes (after dehydrating them via baking), I tried them out. Note: the chocolate shoe mold doesn't offer different sizes, so the shoes were a bit smug. I won't let that impact my current review, however; I am focused on the spaghetti.<br />Unfortunately, I have to label the shoes as a failure for several reasons:<br /><br />Durability: the packaging doesn't warn you, but as soon as you bake the previously boiled noodles, they tend to crack without too much strain. I am 14 pounds, and I cracked my right shoes after 2 steps. The left held out for 14.5 steps (a large gust of wind was the source of demise). Needless to say, I had to make 7 pairs of shoes to make it to the bathroom.<br /><br />Shock absorber: after baking the noodles, they refused to give as they tried to act as a medium between the ground and my feet. I suffer from lower-back problems, and the incessant cracking of the noodles absorbed shock temporarily, but failed to work for too long (steps 3-14.5 for the left foot)<br /><br />Style options: Sadly, De Cocco doesn't offer spaghetti in a variety of colors, such as turquoise and violet. I like to branch out from the norm, and I find myself with similar shoes to my peers as a result of the manufacturer's failure to diversify.<br /><br />These are three of the primary reasons that I have to label the spaghetti as ""minimally versatile.""",0

The day of the party, the cake tastes great - no detection of colorant bitterness, but 2-day old cake will seem to have a strange taste, maybe the color finally settling in.  The colors are great, and because they are dropper bottles, you can control the amount - they are very concentrated pigments, so one drop will do wonders.  If you want really dark colors, you will probably achieve it with just a few drops, but beware, it will, like other colorants, stain your countertop, fingers, tongue, skin, so plan on it and protect your counters, etc.  We are used to this, but obviously, wipe spills quickly.

282057,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""",4,1342310400,Creamy and Smells Good,"I have used shampoos of various types for my entire life.  Some shampoo has been expensive and some has been inexpensive.  All of them have cleaned my hair, but some shampoos have a more pleasant smell than other shampoos, and some shampoos leave my hair softer than other shampoos.  This shampoo seems to be above average with respect to how soft it leaves my hair and the smell of my hair after shampooing.  This shampoo also seems to leave my scalp less itchy than other shampoos.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I opened the shampoo is the pleasant odor.  The odor seems to be floral or fruity; it is hard to tell which.  I did not notice the smell of the shampoo in the shower or the bathroom, which means that the odor is not overpowering.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed is the iridescence in the shampoo.  The shampoo appears much like a metallic paint, and is almost beautiful.<br /><br />I applied the shampoo to my hair and was surprised and pleased at how creamy it was.  The shampoo is much thicker than other shampoos I typically use.  I wanted to keep shampooing my hair because the feel of the shampoo in my hair was so nice.<br /><br />After shampooing my hair, my hair felt very clean and seemed quite manageable rather than limp and lifeless.  The odor the shampoo left behind was pleasant.  It seemed to me that my scalp itched less than it usually does with my standard shampoo.  Even better, my hair felt soft and clean the second day after I used the shampoo.<br /><br />This shampoo has a bunch of miscellaneous stuff that falls under the heading of nutrients and botanicals.  I am unable to tell much about the effectiveness of these various ingredients.  The ingredients sound impressive, but your hair is dead and I am unsure as to the effectiveness of fertilizing your skin.<br /><br />There remains one important aspect to this shampoo, which is the same as for any shampoo, and that is price.  After comparing the price of this shampoo to several other shampoos, I conclude that this shampoo is about average price or perhaps slightly above the average price for most shampoos.<br /><br />Shampoo serves at least one or two useful and important functions.  Shampoo cleans your hair and helps it smell nice.  In addition, shampoo may help keep your hair and scalp soft.  This shampoo also seems to reduce the itch that some people have after using shampoo.  From an esthetic perspective, I think the shampoo is beautiful with metallic-looking iridescence.  The price seems to be competitive to other shampoos.  I think this shampoo has a lot going for it.<br /><br />Enjoy!",0

Unlike traditional teabags, teaballs can be used for at least three brewings, and one ball is even enough to brew an entire pot of tea.  This particular blooming tea might be on the pricy side for just two ounces, but in the long run it saves more money than getting a lot of teabags that might be cheaper but which can only be used for one cup of tea and still retain much flavor.  This tea still packs its full flavor after the first use and after the first day!  This was also my first time experiencing white tea, which, as it turns out, is lowest in caffeine of any of the other types of tea and is the highest in antioxidants.

175466,L. R. Arnold,4,1230508800,Great toy!!,"I have a 1 year old Jack Russell Terrier.  She has chewed me out of house and home (literally).  She chewed a huge hole in my kitchen floor, all the way thru to the crawlspace, then proceeded to chew thru the back door (yep you guessed it... she succeeded).  Anyway, stuffed toys are a joke to her.  They last all of 2 minutes, no matter how ""tuff"" they claim to be.  She generally has no interest in the rubber ""Kong"" types, so I was skeptical about this Everlasting Toy.  Boy was I wrong.  She is completely addicted. She carries it everywhere.  The disk treat inside lasted about a day.  She had more fun licking it than trying to get it out of the toy.  She finally licked it down so far that it pretty much came out on it's own.  I stuffed little treats in the other side.  She could not put it down.  After going at it a full day, she finally got it empty.  I inspected it at that point.  Not a single puncture or tear.  This thing is amazing.  It was a little pricey at Petsmart.  I'll get the refills here.  Definately worth the $$.  She's about 18 lbs, so I got the medium size.  Perfect fit.<br />*** CON:  The Chicken flavor disks do smell a little yucky.  And, after awhile of constant licking, they also get a little slimey.  I would suggest keeping it off the furniture.",0

78866,ExpectoPatronum,3,1332028800,Sweet taste and shell bits (See customer image I uploaded),I tried a can of crab from the grocery store that was $4 a can. All is was was particles of crab meat kind of like coffee grinds out of a used coffee filter. It really didn't have a flavor to it. I ended up just putting it on some lettuce with ranch and ate it like a salad. I will never buy it again.<br /><br />But I really love crab meat and sushi but I can't really afford it nor do I have the time to dine out much. So I'm looking for some type of substitute for fresh seafood even though I know it won't be nearly as good so I have extremely low expectations.<br /><br />This was more like shredded crab mixed with particles of crab meat BUT there were a few thicker pieces in there like maybe from the leg of a very tiny crab. So it was better than the grocery store kind I tried and cheaper. BUT this brand had pieces of shell in it--the other did not. This one had sugar added to it so it tasted sweet which makes no sense to me.<br /><br />So I might possibly try this again knowing full well I'd do better just going to a Chinese buffet since that's the closet I will get to fresh crab in Appalachia. It's not something I will buy reguarly. Maybe once a month or every couple months. It's cheap. It somewhat has a crab taste if you use your imagination. It basically tastes like tuna.<br /><br />I will save up some money and try lump crab meat in a can next. Wish me luck.,0

367628,"OrangeCrush ""Still shooting with Film!""",5,1319673600,Amazing Stuff!,"We initially purchased Coconut Oil for dietary reasons. My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles that stated how healthy Coconut oil is and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our diets. We have since incorporated it into many aspects of our diets. In particular, its amazing with some of the juicing recipes we have come up with. I also enjoy cooking with it, but only with certain meals. Its important to note that cooking oils at high temperatures really cuts down on the nutritional content. So we always cook at lower temperatures when using Coconut or Olive oil. Anyways, we have come to love Coconut oil and it now has a permanent spot in our food pantry.<br /><br />We also started making homemade soap a few years back and while we didn't use coconut oil originally, we figured we would try it since we already had jars of it sitting on our shelves. Well, to make a long story short, its now incorporated in every single one of our recipes. In fact, my favorite soap is actually a recipe that focuses specifically on the coconut oil.<br /><br />Lastly, my wife one upped the soap making and started making homemade shampoo and conditioners and to say that they are amazing is a massive understatement. In particular, the conditioner she makes is unbelievable. I dont know the recipes but I do know that coconut oil is one of the major ingredients that she uses. My hair has never been softer and neither has hers. On top of that the smell is absolutely hypnotic.<br /><br />Bottom line - 12 months ago Coconut oil had absolutely no place in our home. Fast forward to today and....well, it now plays an major role in our lives, both for dietary and hygienic purposes. Even if you dont make homemade soaps, the health benefits alone should be more than enough for you to incorporate Coconut oil into your diet. Its one of the healthiest oils out there.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.",1

Usually this is an all-summer problem for me and I've tried a bunch of different lotions and other remedies to try and clear it up. This is the first thing that actually worked. We just had a 95+ degree heat wave in my state and my skin is as smooth as ever! I couldn't be happier. I was honestly not expecting this to work, but it completely does.<br /><br />As for the glowing skin and blemish-free face, I cannot say. I don't normally have bad acne to start with, but I have noticed that any little issues that pop up aren't really as red as they could be, which is certainly a bonus as I wasn't really drinking this tea for that. I can't vouch for my skin glowing, but then, what does that even really mean?<br /><br />The flavor is pretty boring. It tastes somewhere between air and green tea.

383867,Lurfy's Ma,2,1281571200,"Great flavor, way too many husks","First the good news: These groats have great flavor -- rich, nutty, slightly fruity, and just a little sweet. For many years, I have been eating steel cut oats, mostly from Honeyville Farms. (See: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006ZN4XY"">Steel Cut Oats CAN, 4.38 lb.</a>.) Steel cut oats are so much better than smashed oatmeal and groats are even better. I don't know if these groats are a different variety of oats or if it's just that they are whole groats, but the flavor is distinctly different from the steel cut. I love the steel cut, so this is not to denigrate them, but these groats have a much more complex flavor that I really like.<br /><br />The bad news, which I hope only pertains to this supplier, is the number of husks. Sometimes it's only 1-2/bowl. Sometimes it 1-2 in every spoonful. There is also something gritty from time to time. This really detracts from enjoying the rich, nutty flavor.<br /><br />Groats require a lot more cooking than steel cut and they absorb at least twice as much water. My cooking method for steel cut is to bring them to a boil in a 2:1 water:oats mixture and then leave in the frig overnight. That barely gets is started with groats.<br /><br />So far, the best method I have found is to simmer them in a 4:1 (water:groats) mixture for about 30-45 minutes or until almost all of the water is absorbed or gone. I use the microwave with 1/2 to 3/4 cup groats and 4x the water. I bring it to a boil and then simmer on low power. I usually set it for 30 minutes and then check. When almost all of the water is gone, I put them in the frig overnight (covered). Sometimes they are too dry the next day. I'm still experimenting with the details. I like the microwave because I don't have to be right there to make sure it doesn't go dry and burn. And if it sits a little while, that just continues the softening process.<br /><br />I tried cooking them in my rice cooker (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G30ESY"">Zojirushi NS-LAC05 Micom 3-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer, Stainless Steel</a>). I used one scoop of groats (~3/4 cup) and, based on the results above, filled the pan to the 2-scoop level (double the amount of water). I set it to be ready at 8:30 the next morning. When I woke up, the house had a nice aroma of something cooking. It was a little like when I cook rice and a little like peanuts. Pleasant. When I opened the rice cooker, I found that the groats had expanded more than with the other methods. I added milk (half and half) and raisins and reheated in the microwave. The oatmeal was just about perfect. The groats had expanded to at least 2-3 times original size and were tender and soft, but still much more chewy than the steel cut. The yield was about 1.5-2.0 cups. Absolutely delicious, very filling, and completely different from steel cut oats.<br /><br />Now for the bad news. This really messed up the rice cooker. It cooked overnight, so I was not there so watch it, but I imagine that it bubbled up through the steam vent in the top. There was dried (cooked on) oat residue on the roof of the cooker and all inside the lid. I had to take it apart to clean it - about an hour. Do NOT try this at home. ;-)<br /><br />I imagine a slow cooker would work better, but I don't have one to try.<br /><br />I also want to try Moon Glough's suggestion of toasting them first.<br /><br />I also tried putting them in the food processor just to compare that with the steel cut. I tried several times with varying amounts of processing from just barely to almost a powder. They all came out like mush and tasted bland. It's a puzzle to me why the taste should be so much different.<br /><br />I love the taste, but am rating this product only 2 stars because of the husks and grit. It takes away too much of the enjoyment and it is not attractive if you are not eating alone. I'm going to try groats from other suppliers, including Honeyville farms. I hope someone has better quality control.",0

The flavor is really bright and enhances quite a few dishes, from meats to veggies and even desserts. I decided to buy some for my home recently here. I find it is better used as a finisher, i.e.  sprinkled on foods. I also use it in seafood rubs quite often. My favorite uses are sprinkled on fresh veggies such as cucumber slices and heirloom tomatoes, on chocolate/caramel dishes, and used with seafood. I have several salts, so i generally use this for those three purposes, but sometimes, I'll add it to other dishes as well. It doesnt really dissolve quickly (probably due to the red clay which gives it its color), so it is better used in dishes where that isnt an expectation.

I brewed the first teacup and after almost 10 minutes the tea tasted like flavored hot water. Mind you it was not a cinnamon or vanilla flavor. More like a watery Chamomile and a vague Sarsaparilla. I put another tea bag in to strengthen it but it just tasted like some sort of cleaner at that point with no cinnamon or vanilla to be found. I gave the other 99 tea bags away. I just found Good Earth Sweet and Spicy caffeine free Organic tea with no artificial anything, so hopefully it will do the trick when it arrives!",0

I'll be truthful - my dog loved this and ate it happily.  I mixed it it with his regular dog food and he just gobbled it right up.  However, my dog doesn't do well on foods loaded with grains so I won't likely be buying this despite how much he loved it.  Here are the ingredients in order by weight:<br /><br />Beef  - good to see it's the Number 1 ingredient but from her, it gets sketchy<br />Soybean meal<br />Soy Flour<br />Animal fat<br />Brewers Rice (an empty calorie filler leftover from Beer making process)<br />Soy Protein Concentrate<br />Corn Gluten Meal (another filler)<br />Ground Yellow Corn (filler)<br />Glycerin<br />Poultry By Product - (ground up bones and feathers)<br />Ground Wheat<br />Animal Digest (??? I think I know what this is and it makes me sick)<br />Pearled Barley (Grains again)<br />Calcium Carbonate (ground up rocks)<br />Calcium Phosphate (ground up rocks)<br />Salt<br />Grilled Siloin Steak FLAVOR (no meat)<br />Dried Grean Beans<br />Dried Potatoes<br />Sulfur, Vitamin E,<br /> Choline Chloride,<br /> Zinc Sulfate,  Ferrous Sulfate (both colorants)<br />Added colors - about 5<br />Niacin<br />Wheat Flour (grains again)<br /> and so on and so forth.. the same as basically what's in Beneful.<br /><br />My advice - if you have to go with a Grocery Store brand, don't be folled by a fancy photo on the bag of Sirloin Steak.  Compare the ingredients and buy what you can get the most of for your money IF YOUR DOG CAN EAT THAT STUFF.  Mine can but I still go the extra mile and try and by a more meat based diet.  While I was pleased that Beef was the first ingredient, I prefer to see the first few ingreidents be meat and never to see fillers like Corn and Brewers Rice.<br /><br />So  2 stars for taste, 1 star for being the same as every grocery store brand from Purina who makes this and  two stars OFF for deceptive packaging and advertising.

4785,Shari,5,1308787200,Newman's Own Organics Dog Food,"I switched my mini-Schauzers over to Newman's Own Organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow.  I've been looking for a good quality dog food (rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor.com) without going into debt purchasing it!  I was feeding them a different brand that was ""breed-specific"" food, but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere.  A few places, if they carried it at all, only carried the very small bags (2.5 lbs) and with two dogs, one bag would last about 3 - 5 days.  Plus these little 2.5 lb. bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb. bag  cost!  I tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me, but they conveniently ""forgot"" to place the order, so I was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags.  Then I heard about Newman's Own Organics, which is rated a better dog food than the ""breed-specific"" food I was using and cost $$$ less!  And then I discovered that I could buy this food at Amazon.com, have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery - no brainer!!  No more running out of food, no more driving 50 miles or more to find it, no more hassels!<br /><br />And best and most importantly of all, my little guys LOVE IT!!  Their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover, they seem more active, more alert, more regular and they actually chew this food (they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing!)  I can't say enough good things about both Newman's Own and Amazon's subscription delivery service!",1
379688,W. Bison,4,1323993600,He likes it (and licks it) but sticky ball,"Our dog really likes this thing.  It smells like it is full of flavor, and he seems to really enjoy licking the thing for as long as I'll hold it for him.  If you are unfamiliar, the flavored juice in the container is released each time the dog licks a small ball at the tops of the container; as the ball spins, it gets covered in the juice, which the dog licks off, etc.  So, well done!  My one beef with the product, though, is that the ball is a little tough to get spinning until it is fully lubricated, which means that I often have to use my fingers to get it started, which isn't ideal because I don't want to get any of the flavored juice on me.  That said, my dog is a big fan of this product.  So, while I think this is a good product, I'm giving it four stars because I think the delivery mechanism (ie the ball) isn't the best, and could be improved upon.",0

Well, until I followed a recommendation to try Stonewall Waffles.  Believe me it is not like Bisquick as I thought it might be, it is so much better I was shocked.  And well now the family loves them and looks forward to Sunday waffles every couple weeks.  I even double up the ingredients so I can make extras which we cut into smaller sections and freeze them.  These can then be used for toster waffles and a quick breakfast.  Forget the Eggos even as frozen waffles these are great.<br /><br />What do I like best about them?  The waffles come out light and fluffy.  They are crisp and hold up well to being filled with strawberries, nuts or whatever toppings you may choose.  In no way do they feel heavy or soggy.  They are a snap to prepare, and take just 3 minutes in the waffle maker. Lastly the whole family loves them.  So despite the higher price it is well worth every penny.",1

So sometimes you'll get a few different beans that taste a little weird (we can thank the Bertie Botz that get mixed in).  But for the most part, you get a great variety of beans which to me taste great.  I haven't had any bags that were entirely one thing or another, although one of my bags did have a few more chocolate beans than usual, but again nothing too weird, so I may have lucked out, but from my experience, you get a good variety regardless.  Now I tend to be someone who likes to get a handful and occasionally enjoy one at a time, so if you are the one at a time person, you may have some problems with this bag.  On the other hand, I'm not a very picky person and I really have no complaints. For the price you get an excellent value on beans that would normally cost a lot more.  Overall, I'm glad I get these, and I know whenever they have sales on these I try to pick them up, because they can be difficult to get.  So if you're a fan of Jelly Belly, you've come to the right place, but if you're a little bit particular on beans, I'd suggest you shy away, or just know you may get some flavors that are not going to make you happy.",1

543839,L. Knights,3,1340150400,Tastes like Crystal Light,"I used to buy Crystal Light all the time, the kind that had vitamins and stuff in it, and this tastes like the citrus or tropical or something fruit punch flavor which I rather like. I gave up Crystal Light a long time ago in favor of water, I figure who needs to be consuming sucralose, but lately I've been making these concoctions of vitamin C powder and/or MSM powder, the juice of a few limes, some liquid stevia and sometimes an Ester-C packet and I thought I could add this in place of the Ester-C and the stevia and then I'd have a tasty beverage WITH caffeine in it but still with the vitamins.<br />So, I made my concoction this way, and it tasted fine. The one thing I was unsure about was the serving size. The bottle says ""one squeeze"", and I think a squeeze could end up being quite a lot of the bottle if you were quite zealous about it. The side of the bottle says that a serving is 1/2 ounce, which I originally calculated as two tablespoons, but on further reflection I realized my math must be off and it's one tablespoon, but originally I put two tablespoons in 8 oz of water and it tasted about the right strength to me, so that's about how much I was using. I'd think with one tablespoon it would be a bit weak, but this means I only got 12 servings out of my bottle and not 24.<br />Compared to my usual concoction, a glass of this stuff has almost no vitamin C. It does have 120% of the RDA, but compared to what I usually have that is laughably little. It also says it has 40mg of caffeine in a serving, so I tried drinking a bunch of it in an afternoon, but it didn't make me feel a caffeine buzz or anything.<br />Anyway, I've used almost all the bottle and won't be seeking it out when it's gone. The flavor is basically good but I'm not into all that sucralose, artificial color and it kind of rubs me the wrong way that it says ""each squeeze into water adds more flavor and nutrition"". Like it's some kind of health food product or something. Ooooh...nutritious! Why have fruits and vegetables when you can just have vitamin squeeze energy drink!?",0

Cane sugar is unrefined and slightly less glycemic as regular sugar (meaning raise blood sugar levels) and isn't stripped from its natural nutrients. It's more pricey than the stuff we usually get.<br /><br />So, if you're wanting to try a new energy drink, then you can try this. If you already drink coffee regularly, it might be a nice non-teeth-staining alternative.

This product tastes awesome on toast, banana pieces, mixed with ice cream or oatmeal or straight out of the jar (my personal favorite).  It is so smooth that I could envision one using this spread as an icing for cupcakes or cake.<br /><br />There is no indication on the jar that the product must be refrigerated.  I typically refrigerate my peanut butters and other nut butters so I did that with this product and it did make the product more stiff.  If you wanted to use this as a frosting, you would need to heat it slightly after refrigeration.<br /><br />A serving is 2 tablespoons and has 180 calories, 14 grams of fat (3 grams saturated), 2 grams of dietary fiber, 9 grams of sugar and 4 grams of protein.  The product's ingredients include: dry roasted almonds, evaporated can juice, palm oil, cocoa powder, non-fat dry milk, canola oil, soy lecithin, natural vanilla flavor and salt.<br /><br />While the product is vegetarian, it is not vegan due to the milk content and those sensitive to soy should be cautious.

The first time we tried this Sprout stage 3 Butternut Squash Mac & Cheese, my little-one gagged so hard that her eyes watered!  (And she also panicked a little ... very scary for Mom & Dad!)  I know that a bit of gagging is to be expected when introducing a baby to textured solids, but this was well beyond the norm.  I then tried some of the Mac & Cheese myself, and while it was certainly flavorful, it contained pretty large chunks of food, like whole pieces of elbow macaroni.  Plus, it was so thick that you could barely stir it with a spoon.  Definitely too much for my baby, who'd only had smooth purees up to that point.  Sprout is definitely the thickest and chunkiest of the organic stage 3 baby foods that I've tried.  The stage 3 training dinners from Plum Organics and Ella's Kitchen are textured, but they contain very small, soft bits of meat, vegetables and rice/pasta that were much easier for my baby to manage (i.e., little or no gagging).<br /><br />Once your baby is comfortable eating chunky textured solids, Sprout stage 3 baby foods are bound to become a favorite.  The Mac & Cheese (and the other flavors) are very tasty and well-seasoned, minus the added salt and sugar, which babies don't need.  And Sprout baby food is certified organic to boot.  Therefore, I'll be storing these stage 3 pouches in the back of my pantry for a few weeks until my baby girl is ready for them.<br /><br />For advanced textured solid-eaters: A<br />For newbies: C",0

Almost all other supposed relaxation-inducing herbal blends have the opposite effect on me, making me very restless, especially if I use them more than once.  I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced the calming effects of this blend ?",1

The taste by itself is a base and by adding olive oil seasoned with garlic , some salt etc the flavor boosts dramatically.  A spoonful on some chopped celery with olive oil and garlic and wow. Mix this with a baked scouped out roasted eggplant and it becomes sensational.  I am going to try it on some black beans  I heard of a man who made his tuna fish salad with this.  Traditionally it is mixed in with mashed chick peas for hummus.  Eat it with crackers or pieces of red pepper and other veggies for a healthy snack.

This is totally the opposite.<br /><br />I brew a batch in the coffee machine, and when I take a sip the first thing I taste is a smooth medium roast which is actually more than decent.  I didn't really pick up the hint of sweetness the pecan was giving off until my 3rd or 4th sip.  Very subtle at first, but more noticeable once you know it's there.  Definitely not overpowering, but just enough where you might think twice about adding sweetener to it.  I tried it in the french press, and man!  it's twice as good.  Really brings out the richness and pecan flavor!<br /><br />This coffee smells so good out of the bag you almost want to eat the beans by themselves.  And again, the best part is that the way it smells when you brew it is exactly how it tastes.  It's nothing but a good smooth cup of coffee.  Can't wait to try the other flavors.",1

Finally, one day when I ran out and wanted to pick up some more, I found the Ice Breakers Sours (Mixed Berry) and I started using them. At first, he seemed startled at the drastic change in flavor.

Even using as a single shot, the coffee tastes watered down.<br />2.  The version of of foil seals in my box are self-adhesive; much less fooling around than the peel-off rings contained in other kits.  Still this foil is much thinner than that found on standard Nespresso capsules, and may contribute to the excessive grinds that show up in the brewed product.<br />3.  I want fiber in my diet, but not fiber in my coffee; there are ALWAYS residual coffee grinds in the cup.  The brewed coffee often looks murky; there is always a ring of tiny coffee grinds.<br />4.  There are no instructions in the box, but the tiny rings SEEM to belong on the underside of the capsule, as without them the capsules tend to fall right through the slot on the Nespresso machine.  Why bother with the rings?  Why not make the the capsule tops a bit thicker in the first place?<br /><br />So until they make a bigger capsule, and solve the ""dirty coffee"" problem, this is a Two Star product.",0

231004,Current Resident,1,1336780800,Loaded with sugars and contains undeclared fats; not a health food,"People, learn how to read nutrition labels. Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the ""Fat Free"" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type ""snackwell devil food nutrition facts"" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that ""Fat Free"" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other ""health-conscience"" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore ""helpful review"" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics.",0

This cereal has a slight bitter aftertaste when you don't add anything to it or mix it with anything. I am not quite sure what it is due to, and I can't taste the bitterness if I mix it with a good amount of honey, or brown sugar, or butter or maple syrup. However if you like to eat your cereal without any sweetening added at all then I think it is not the right cereal for you.<br /><br />I think if you mix this hot cereal with other cereals it will improve their texture and you probably wont notice the aftertaste.",0

When I opened one of the cans I noticed that my can opener created little dents all the way around the can when I was done. I don't believe it is Amazon's fault that the cans arrived dented.<br /><br />The dented cans wasn't my biggest dissapointment. I have been using Thai Kitchen's coconut milk. I decided to try Chaokoh since it is supposed to be so great. Comparing the two, Thai Kitchen is, in my opinion, higher quality. It is thicker, creamier, and more oily. In contrast, Chaokoh is more wattered down and seems to lack some of the coconut oil present in Thai Kitchen. The taste isn't much different but the ingredients are. Thai Kitchen has no preservatives and is basically soaked and pressed coconut meat. Chaokoh contains citric acid and sodium metabisulfite as preservatives.<br /><br />Given the choice, I'll take the cheaper, more natural, preservative free option with a better texture.<br /><br />Oh, and I've ordered at least 5 12 pack cases of Thai Kitchen coconut milk and have yet to recieve a dented can and my can opener does not dent them either.",0

If you are a fan of this flavor I would guess this brand is a very good one to go with.<br /><br />11/07/2011 - Update.  After the first few bags of this tea I became addicted so I'm finally making my rounds back through to update my review from 4 stars to 5.  This really is a great product and the flavor, albeit different, grows on you in short order.  I use a mixture of regular table sugar and Stevia extract in mine because I'm trying to cut down on my sugar intake, but still have that sweet tooth and prefer my tea and coffee sweet.  I have found that I can't over steep this tea and usually leave it in for 10 minutes minimum; however I typically place a single bag in a 16 ounce cup.  Sometimes I even leave the tea bag in the cup while I'm drinking it and have never experienced the bad taste you get from over steeping regular tea.  If you like it really strong you might want to stick with an 8 ounce cup, but keep the 10 minute steep time for full flavor and antioxidant benefit.  For those hot summer nights, reduce the water to 10 ounces (or less) and pour it over ice after it is done steeping.  This flavor is really good hot or cold.<br /><br />11/13/2011 - Update two.  I tried to save a few dollars and decided to purchase the loose tea this time around since it is about half the price.  Unfortunately the brand I purchased (Davidson's) lacks the body and flavor of the Choice brand.  When brewing the loose tea I placed 4 teaspoons in my brewing basket and everything else was the same as what I used when brewing the Choice brand as mentioned above.  It just wasn't the same experience.  On the next brew I added an extra teaspoon and it still wasn't the same.  This tells me the quality of the Choice brand must be really good!  I might have to pay extra and just keep using the bag tea.",1

If I can find them, they are overpriced and of inferior quality (parmigiano reggiano anyone ?). I often feel that people are knowingly tricked by the industry by product names which resemble the ""real product"", the best example would be olive oil.<br /><br />Happy of at least finding one of my favorite pasta brands (""deCecco""), I was looking for the San Marzano tomatoes which I was used to get at my local italian grocery store for 1.50 Euros (about 1.80 USD) a can (the acidity of most american canned tomatoes is too high, in my opinion).<br /><br />So far, I have only found this brand at the local grocery stores, and after reading the label, I was very suspicious about it - a San Marzano tomato, produced in USA ? I gave it a chance anyways, at last, they have a high price and they are still on the market, so they might have something going for them.<br /><br />After opening the can, I instantly saw that these can not be real San Marzano tomatoes - San Marzanos are long and thin and bittersweet (once you tried them, you will be able to tell), these are spherical and sweet and sour.<br /><br />I have used them in soup and pasta sauces so far, at least they seem to be a little better than the regular canned tomatoes in the grocery store, but it can not justify the price tag - in Europe I can get this quality for about a dollar.<br /><br />So if you are searching for a good canned tomato, keep on searching - these here might not taste all that bad, but they are not San Marzanos and they are expensive as well.",0

They aren't really top grade, but nor are they bottom shelf and make for a fine daily bag tea.<br /><br />However, I found their Green Tea to be a bit bland.  Indeed, it is the ""light flavour strength"", as it says on the box, but I wasn't prepared for just how light the flavor would be.  Supposedly, the tea used here is sencha, but I have had many, many cups of sencha and it generally has a bolder, grassier flavor.<br /><br />Because the flavor is so light to begin with, you can't really pull more than one cup out of a bag either.  The next cup is just pretty much colored water, which is disappointing.  A nice strong tea usually yields a few cups, and that saves you some money in the long term.<br /><br />People who don't really enjoy the strong, grassy flavor of green tea might find this a nice balance.

Tastes like Kellogg's dusted your morning bowl of cornflakes with crushed peanut brittle!,"I just got my first box of Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut today, and as soon as I opened the inner bag, a delicious, sweet scent reminiscent of Crunch & Munch wafted out. Since I've been eying these boxes at my local Wally World for a few weeks, I was excited to see what this cereal would taste like.<br /><br />At first glance, it was clear that there was plenty of honey and sugar glazing these flakes and gluing the small chips of peanut to said flakes. This cereal won't be your family's health nut's new favorite, but Kellogg's is also not hiding behind any unfounded health claims here. The nutritional information is easy to find, and it's about what you'd expect for a product named ""Golden Honey Nut"". It's also undoubtedly as delicious as you'd hope a food product by that name would be!<br /><br />After getting my first whiff, I HAD to have a bowl (of course, I'll probably only be having a salad as my actual dinner now tonight, but it was TOTALLY worth it)! As other reviewers here have mentioned, the heavy sugar/honey glaze keeps these very crunchy in milk for longer than you'd have with more lightly glazed flakes. I also noticed that within about 30 seconds' time of having the milk in my bowl of cereal, it was lightly colored by the honey coating (which turned my milk a soft honey yellow). I couldn't tell that there were peanut pieces on the flakes as I ate them, which I consider to be something of a good thing - it wouldn't be terribly pleasant to me to have to deal with chunks of peanut sticking to and between my teeth as I tried to get my bowl of morning sustenance down (I'm a die-hard cereal-for-breakfast kinda girl; always have been, always will be).<br /><br />Nutritionally speaking, this cereal compares closely to Honey Bunches of Oats. The two are quite similar in all of the stats you'd focus on, including the added vitamins and minerals. This cereal is delicious and satisfying, but if you're looking for Kashi's cousin, this isn't it (thankfully for me, too: Kashi's healthy, but it's not terribly tasty, IMHO).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this cereal. It's sweet, delicious and crunchy, and would also make a good, lower calorie substitution for your dessert, if you're so inclined (or a great crushed topping on yogurt or ice cream). Next time you're at the store, take a look at the stats for yourself, and if you're interested, grab a box.

Unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that can't be broken down easily.  These products do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals) So if it says ""chicory root"" or ""inulin"" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.  So if you want lots of sugar and fat without fiber, this product is for you.",0

I had him on Innova Lg Breed Senior and he maintained his high weight.  He's been eating this for about 3-4 months now, has lost 4 lbs. and no longer gets the gurgling stomach.  He seems vibrant as ever.  Though I typically add a little meat, he is willing to eat this food dry on its own (something he's never done with other foods).  The only downside I have noticed is that it makes his stools VERY smelly - not sure if this is because he's sensitive to an ingredient or a result of the probiotics/supplements the food contains.",0

But still, I had to be cautious as I prepared my bowl of yumminess not to get my heart broken for the first time.<br /><br />As I am typing this I look sadly at my glass, as it is not half full or even half empty but it is totally empty and I am beginning to eat the remaining ice because there is still a little remnants of matcha hanging onto the cubes. If I could get my tongue down into the tall glass I would lick the inside of it!<br /><br />Having made my typical matcha latte, cold, with ice, creamer, milk, and the matcha mix I  think I gulped it down in a matter of minutes, and I am being generous, it was probably more like a manner of seconds! Its a wonder I even can recall what it tasted like as it blasted past my taste buds so quickly!<br /><br />It was in fact nutty, buttery, caramlish but with the toffee flavor of correctly burnt sugar flavor, and of course just the right amount of chocolate but not so much to mask the other wonderful flavors! And as always the amazing matcha powder base shines through taking away the guilt of the sweetly sinful, ummm sweetness!<br /><br />So again Red Leaf you delight me!

539418,"Sunday ""SundayAtDusk""",3,1228953600,Great Ingredients...If Only They Would Eat It....,"I had a whole case of this to try, so thought it would be fun to try it on as many cats as possible. Thus, by recruiting 5 friends, we ended up trying Petite Cuisine chicken cat food on 13 cats--7 males & 6 females; 4 inside cats, 5 outside & 4 inside/outside. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food--namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.<br /><br />I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat--a 2 year old male--ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male--a 16 pound inside/outside orange tabby--would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the broth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of broth, which I think is brilliant, since all the cats I know always like the broth of canned cat food or tuna best.<br /><br />I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked. It has great ingredients and smells like human food. I hope to try Petite Cuisine seafood catfood one day...I think they all might like that much better.",0

77378,Nancy,5,1293408000,We love it,"My dad and I love pickled garlic, and this is our preferred brand for some reason (but I don't see any difference between this and Garlic World's).  The garlic isn't nearly as strong as it would be raw. If you like pickles and garlic, try this!",1
140612,Sunny,3,1328054400,Dogswell Vitality,My dogs don't like this one as much as Happy Hips. Got it for their skin and coats but at least with one of my dogs there is some ingredient that causes her to scratch more. Wish Dogswell would look into what ingredient would cause an allergic reaction and make the change.,0
8864,"Grammy M ""Grammy""",5,1287360000,Great raw diet food for on the go!,"I've always wanted to go to a raw diet for my Cairn but in its frozen form it took up too much room in our RV fridge/freezer as we travel/camp a lot!  A friend recently told me about Addiction and this is the answer for us - takes up little space in our cupboard and provides a healthy diet, along with a mixture of Wysong Epigen kibble, and fresh fruits and vegetables that our Cairn loves; he's a very happy camper!  The cats at home love it, too!  We've only tried Brushtail but get the Venison treats for variety.  I'm sure we'll try the others, too, for a change up from time to time - (done in moderation and over a period of time so as not to upset the tummies!)!!!!",1
432176,tonabj,2,1309219200,Great tea - way too much money,This tea used to be a little more expensive than WalMart or Sam's Club.  Now it is outrageous.  Will not order again.  $8.43 increase per case in two months.,0
559450,Erin,5,1334620800,Well worth the wait!,"I saw these in my local grocery store and passed since I had given up sweets for Lent. Well, as a regular Oreo lover, I was still intrigued so I ordered 2 boxes from amazon.com. I kept them at home until Easter Sunday.<br /><br />And was it worth it!  They taste similar to a regular Oreo, but are a little sweeter.  The extra sweetness makes them seem ""richer"" so fewer cookies will fill you up. But, they taste FANTASTIC.  Yum!<br /><br />Totally worth it. Enjoy!",1
398982,LMM,5,1350604800,BEST ever,"You can't beat Watkins for their nutmeg. The aromatic freshness enhances the whole flavor impact of french toast, eggnog, quiche, etc, thanks for the speedy delivery too!",1
521131,Shortbread,4,1345766400,1 out of 3 boxes stale,We love this cereal and found that the value offered by Amazon's Subscribe and Save deal was great. Only problem is that quality may be hit or miss - one out of the three boxes we received was stale and tasted pretty bad.,0
